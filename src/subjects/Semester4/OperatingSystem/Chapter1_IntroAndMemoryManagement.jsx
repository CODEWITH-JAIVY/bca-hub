        <h3>Functions of an Operating System</h3>
        <p>
          The OS performs several core functions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Resource Management:</strong> The OS manages various computer resources, including the CPU, memory, and peripherals, ensuring that each process gets what it needs to run efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Process Management:</strong> The OS handles the execution of processes, including scheduling, creating, and terminating processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Memory Management:</strong> The OS allocates and deallocates memory to processes, optimizes memory usage, and prevents processes from interfering with each other's memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>File Management:</strong> The OS provides a structured way to organize and access files and directories on storage devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device Management:</strong> The OS controls and manages hardware devices, such as printers, keyboards, and displays, providing an interface for processes to interact with them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Memory Management */}
      <section>
        <h3>Memory Management</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Memory Management?</strong><br />
          Memory management is the function of the OS responsible for allocating and deallocating memory to processes. It ensures that each process has the necessary memory space to execute and that no two processes interfere with each other's memory space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Need for Memory Management</strong><br />
          Memory management is essential because:
          <ul>
            <li>It ensures that multiple processes can run concurrently without conflicts.</li>
            <li>It optimizes the utilization of limited memory resources.</li>
            <li>It provides protection by preventing processes from accessing memory outside their allocated space.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hierarchy of Memory</strong><br />
          Computer systems use a hierarchy of memory to balance speed and cost:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Registers:</strong> Fastest and most expensive memory, located within the CPU.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cache:</strong> Fast memory located between the CPU and main memory, storing frequently accessed data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Main Memory (RAM):</strong> The primary memory that the CPU directly accesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secondary Storage (Disk):</strong> Non-volatile memory for long-term storage of data.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Memory Management Techniques</h3>

        {/* Partitioning */}
        <h4>Partitioning</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Partitioning?</strong><br />
          Partitioning involves dividing the main memory into multiple sections, each of which can hold a single process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fixed Partitioning:</strong> In fixed partitioning, the memory is divided into partitions of equal or unequal fixed sizes. The sizes are determined at system generation time, and it can't be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Variable Partitioning:</strong> In variable partitioning, the partitions are created dynamically, with their size matching the needs of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of Partitioning:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Simple to implement.</li>
            <li>Provides isolation between processes.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disadvantages of Partitioning:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Internal Fragmentation:</strong> Occurs when a process is smaller than the partition it is allocated to, resulting in wasted space within the partition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>External Fragmentation:</strong> Occurs when there is enough total memory to accommodate a process, but it is divided into non-contiguous blocks that are too small individually.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        {/* Paging */}
        <h4>Paging</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Paging?</strong><br />
          Paging is a memory management technique that divides both the physical memory and the logical address space into fixed-size blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pages and Frames:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pages:</strong> The logical address space is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Frames:</strong> The physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called frames.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Page Tables:</strong><br />
          The OS uses page tables to map logical pages to physical frames, allowing non-contiguous allocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of Paging:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Reduces external fragmentation by using fixed-size blocks.</li>
            <li>Allows non-contiguous allocation of physical memory.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disadvantages of Paging:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Leads to internal fragmentation because a process might not fully use the last page allocated to it.</li>
            <li>Requires page tables, which add overhead.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How paging reduce external fragmentation?</strong><br />
          Paging reduce external fragmentation by allowing physical memory to be non-contiguous, so we have not to allocate a contiguous block of memory to a process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How paging leads to internal fragmentation?</strong><br />
          Paging leads to internal fragmentation because a process might not fully use the last page allocated to it.
        </p>

        {/* Segmentation */}
        <h4>Segmentation</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Segmentation?</strong><br />
          Segmentation is a memory management technique where the logical address space is divided into variable-sized segments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Segments:</strong><br />
          Segments are logical units of memory, such as code, data, or stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Segment Tables:</strong><br />
          Segment tables map each segment to a physical memory location.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>External Fragmentation in Segmentation:</strong><br />
          Because segments have variable sizes, segmentation can lead to external fragmentation when unused gaps of memory are scattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of Segmentation:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Supports logical memory organization.</li>
            <li>Facilitates sharing of segments between processes.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disadvantages of Segmentation:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Leads to external fragmentation.</li>
            <li>Requires segment tables, which add overhead.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        {/*Paged segmentation*/}
        <h4>Paged segmentation</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Paged Segmentation?</strong><br />
          Paged segmentation combines segmentation and paging to benefit from both methods. The logical address space is first divided into segments, which are then further divided into fixed-size pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of Paged Segmentation:</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Reduces external fragmentation</li>
            <li>Supports logical memory organization.</li>
            <li>Facilitates sharing of segments between processes.</li>

          <br />
            In summary, monolithic kernels offer high performance but lack flexibility and reliability, while microkernels provide better security and flexibility at the cost of performance overhead. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the system being designed.

          <h4>
            2. Describe various types of Operating Systems with real-world examples (Batch, Multitasking, Real-time, etc.).
          </h4>
          <p>
            Operating systems come in various types, each tailored for different environments and tasks:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Batch OS:</strong> Processes jobs in batches, without direct user interaction. These systems were common in early computing where jobs were collected in groups and executed sequentially.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Real-world example:</strong> Payroll processing systems that run at scheduled intervals.

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multitasking OS:</strong> Allows multiple tasks to run seemingly at the same time. It rapidly switches between tasks, giving the illusion of parallel execution.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Real-world example:</strong> Modern desktop OS like Windows or macOS, where you can browse the web, edit documents, and play music simultaneously.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Time-Sharing OS:</strong> A type of multitasking OS that allows multiple users to share a computer simultaneously. Each user gets a small time slice to execute their tasks.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Real-world example:</strong> Unix systems, which allow multiple users to log in and use the system at the same time.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Real-Time OS:</strong> Designed for systems where strict time constraints must be met. They are used in applications where actions must occur within a specific time frame.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Real-world example:</strong> Industrial control systems, medical imaging, and flight control systems.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
