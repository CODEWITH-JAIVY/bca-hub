      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 4: Device and Storage Management</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Welcome to Chapter 4! In this chapter, we're going to explore two crucial areas of operating systems: device management and storage
        management. These are the parts of the OS that make sure your computer can talk to its hardware and store information reliably. Let's dive in!
      </p>

      {/* Device Management */}
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Device Management</h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q1: What is device management in an OS?</strong><br />
        A1: Device management is a key function of an operating system (OS) that oversees and controls all of the computer's hardware devices.
        It coordinates devices, ensures they run smoothly, and makes them available to different processes.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q2: What is the role of device management in an OS?</strong><br />
        A2: Device management enables communication between hardware devices and the OS. It handles device initialization, data transfer, error handling, and access control.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q3: What are the different techniques for device management?</strong><br />
        <strong>Dedicated Devices:</strong> Allocated to a single process (e.g., a tape drive).<br />
        <strong>Shared Devices:</strong> Used by multiple processes concurrently (e.g., printers, disks).<br />
        <strong>Virtual Devices:</strong> Devices that appear dedicated but are shared (e.g., printers with spooling).
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q4: What are the different types of devices?</strong><br />
        <strong>Input/Output (I/O) Devices:</strong> Keyboards, monitors, etc.<br />
        <strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Hard drives, SSDs, USB drives.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        <strong>Q5: What is buffering and what are its benefits?</strong><br />
        Buffering uses a temporary storage area to hold data during transfer. It improves efficiency by allowing devices of different speeds to communicate effectively.
      </p>

      {/* Storage Management */}
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Storage Management</h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q6: What is storage management in an OS?</strong><br />
        A6: It oversees how data is stored and retrieved from storage devices, managing storage space efficiently.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q7: Why is storage management important?</strong><br />
        A7: It ensures data reliability, optimizes storage space usage, minimizes access times, and supports backup and recovery.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q8: What is the secondary storage structure?</strong><br />
        A8: Disks consist of platters, tracks, and sectors. The read/write head moves across sectors to access data.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q9: What is disk scheduling and what are its goals?</strong><br />
        A9: Disk scheduling manages disk I/O requests, aiming to minimize seek time, improve throughput, and ensure fairness.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        <strong>Q10: Explain the different disk scheduling algorithms.</strong><br />
        <strong>FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):</strong> Simple but inefficient.<br />
        <strong>SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):</strong> Minimizes seek time but may cause starvation.<br />
        <strong>SCAN (Elevator):</strong> Moves in one direction then reverses, reducing starvation.<br />
        <strong>C-SCAN (Circular SCAN):</strong> Moves one way and jumps back without servicing on return, ensuring uniform wait times.<br />
        <strong>LOOK:</strong> Similar to SCAN but stops at the last request.<br />
        <strong>C-LOOK:</strong> Similar to LOOK but jumps back after last request.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q11: What are the key tasks involved in disk management?</strong><br />
        Formatting (prepare the disk), partitioning (divide into sections), and bad block handling (manage defective sectors).
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Q12: What is swap-space management?</strong><br />
        A12: Swap space acts as an overflow for RAM, temporarily holding inactive processes when memory is full.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        <strong>Q13: Why is disk reliability important, and what are some techniques to ensure it?</strong><br />
        <strong>RAID:</strong> Provides redundancy and improves performance.<br />
        <strong>Error Detection and Correction:</strong> Ensures data integrity.
      </p>

        {/* Question 20 */}
        <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-5 mb-2">
          20. Explain memory management techniques: contiguous allocation, paging, and segmentation.
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>Contiguous Allocation:</strong> Each process gets a single continuous block of memory.<br />
          <strong>Advantage:</strong> Simple and fast.<br />
          <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Leads to external fragmentation.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Paging:</strong> Memory divided into fixed-size pages and frames.<br />
          <strong>Advantage:</strong> Reduces external fragmentation.<br />
          <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Can cause internal fragmentation.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Segmentation:</strong> Memory divided into logical segments (code, data, stack).<br />
          <strong>Advantage:</strong> Logical organization of memory.<br />
          <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Causes external fragmentation.
        </p>

        {/* Question 21 */}
        <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-5 mb-2">
          21. What is virtual memory? Describe demand paging and the page fault handling process.
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> Enables execution of processes not fully loaded in main memory.<br /><br />
          <strong>Demand Paging:</strong> Loads pages only when needed.<br /><br />
          <strong>Page Fault Handling Process:</strong><br />
          1. Trap to OS.<br />
          2. Locate page on disk.<br />
          3. Find free frame.<br />
          4. Schedule disk read.<br />
          5. Update page table.<br />
          6. Restart the faulting instruction.
