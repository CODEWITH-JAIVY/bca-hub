            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is a geometric transformation?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: A geometric transformation is a function that maps points from one location to another, altering their position, orientation, or size.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the basic 2D transformations?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Basic 2D transformations include translation, rotation, scaling, and reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is translation?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Translation moves an object from one position to another without changing its orientation or size.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is rotation?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Rotation turns an object around a specified pivot point by a certain angle.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is scaling?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Scaling changes the size of an object, either enlarging it (scaling up) or shrinking it (scaling down).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are the basic 3D transformations?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Basic 3D transformations include translation, rotation, scaling, and reflection, but applied in three dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: How is rotation performed in 3D?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: 3D rotation can be performed around the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, each requiring a separate rotation matrix.
            </p>
