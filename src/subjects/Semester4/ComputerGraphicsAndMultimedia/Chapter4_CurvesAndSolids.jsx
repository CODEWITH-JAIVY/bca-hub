            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What are curves in computer graphics?</strong><br />
                A1: Curves in computer graphics are mathematical representations used to create smooth, continuous lines. These curves are used to model complex shapes and smooth transitions in graphics and animations. A curve can be represented in many ways, but one of the most common ways is by using parametric equations, where a parameter (like `t`) defines points along the curve.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are different types of curves?</strong><br />
                A2: Some of the most widely used curves in computer graphics include:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li><strong>Bezier Curves:</strong> These curves are defined by a set of control points. They are simple to implement and widely used in vector graphics, animation, and font design.</li>
                    <li><strong>B-spline Curves:</strong> These curves provide more flexibility than Bezier curves and allow local control, meaning modifying one control point only affects part of the curve.</li>
                    <li><strong>NURBS Curves:</strong> Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are an extension of B-splines that can represent both standard geometric shapes (like circles and ellipses) and freeform curves.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is a Bezier curve?</strong><br />
                A3: A Bezier curve is a type of parametric curve defined by control points. A quadratic Bezier curve is defined by three points: the start, control, and end points. A cubic Bezier curve, more commonly used, is defined by four points. The curve moves smoothly and continuously through these points. Mathematically, for a cubic Bezier curve, the equation is:<br />
                P(t) = (1 - t)³ * P0 + 3(1 - t)² * t * P1 + 3(1 - t) * t² * P2 + t³ * P3,<br />
                where `t` ranges from 0 to 1, and `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3` are the four control points. The Bezier curve can create a wide range of shapes by manipulating the control points.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is a B-spline curve?</strong><br />
                A4: A B-spline curve, or Basis spline, is a more flexible and powerful curve than a Bezier curve. It is defined by a set of control points, and the curve is calculated using a blending function, which makes it possible to adjust the influence of each control point. Unlike Bezier curves, B-splines do not necessarily pass through all control points, providing more control over the shape. B-splines are widely used in design software due to their ability to create smooth, controlled curves and their local control properties (where altering one point affects only a portion of the curve).

            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are solids in computer graphics?</strong><br />
                A5: Solids are three-dimensional objects that occupy space and have volume. These objects can be defined using mathematical models in 3D graphics. Solids can be represented in various ways depending on the application, and they are crucial for realistic rendering and 3D modeling. Common representations include polygon meshes, boundary representations (B-rep), and constructive solid geometry (CSG).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are different types of solid modeling techniques?</strong><br />
                A6: Solid modeling techniques are methods used to define and represent three-dimensional solids in computer graphics. These include:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li><strong>Boundary Representation (B-rep):</strong> This approach represents a solid by its boundary surfaces, such as faces, edges, and vertices. It is well-suited for complex solids with detailed boundaries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG):</strong> This technique uses Boolean operations (union, intersection, and difference) to combine simple solids like cubes, spheres, and cylinders into more complex shapes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polygon Meshes:</strong> These represent 3D objects using polygons, typically triangles, connected at their vertices. Polygon meshes are commonly used in real-time rendering applications like video games.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parametric Surfaces:</strong> These are surfaces defined by two parameters (often `u` and `v`) that map to points in 3D space. Examples include NURBS surfaces and other parametric representations.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What is B-rep?</strong><br />
                A7: Boundary Representation (B-rep) is a method for representing solids by defining their boundaries—specifically, the faces, edges, and vertices that make up the surface of the solid. This method is ideal for representing complex shapes because each surface can be described as a set of planar or curved faces, and the relationships between the faces define the solid's volume. The B-rep model allows for precise geometric operations and is often used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems for designing mechanical parts and architectural structures.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q8: What is CSG?</strong><br />
                A8: Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a method of creating complex solids by combining simple geometric primitives like cubes, spheres, and cylinders using Boolean operations. These operations include:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li><strong>Union:</strong> Combines two solids into one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intersection:</strong> Creates a solid representing the common volume of two solids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difference:</strong> Subtracts one solid from another.</li>
                </ul>
                CSG is powerful for creating solid models in a way that maintains geometric simplicity, but it can become less efficient for modeling highly complex shapes.

            <p>
                <strong>Q9: How are curves and surfaces represented in computer graphics?</strong><br />
                A9: In computer graphics, curves and surfaces are often represented parametrically. A curve is represented by a parameter (such as `t`) that defines a position along the curve, and a surface is defined by two parameters (often `u` and `v`) that map to points on the surface. Some methods for representing curves and surfaces include:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li><strong>Polygon Meshes:</strong> These represent a surface by using a collection of connected polygons, typically triangles or quadrilaterals, that approximate the shape of the object.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parametric Surfaces:</strong> These surfaces are defined by two parameters, and they can represent more complex shapes like freeform surfaces or complex organic shapes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cubic Curves:</strong> Cubic Bezier curves and B-splines are commonly used to represent smooth curves in 2D and 3D spaces. They are particularly useful for animations and modeling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quadric Surfaces:</strong> These are surfaces that are defined by quadratic equations and can represent shapes like spheres, cones, and ellipsoids. A quadric surface has an equation of the form Ax² + By² + Cz² + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <strong>Q10: What are regularized Boolean set operations?</strong><br />
                A10: Regularized Boolean set operations are a method of performing Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference) while ensuring the result is a valid, non-intersecting solid. These operations are critical for maintaining the integrity of 3D models during operations like merging objects or subtracting shapes. Regularized operations avoid errors like self-intersections or degenerate surfaces, which can cause problems during rendering or further modeling.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q11: What is primitive instancing in solid modeling?</strong><br />
                A11: Primitive instancing refers to using a single instance of a primitive shape (like a sphere or cube) and placing multiple copies (instances) of it within a scene. This technique saves memory because instead of storing multiple copies of the same geometry, the system stores only one instance and places it in different locations. Primitive instancing is useful when creating environments with repeated elements, like trees in a forest or buildings in a cityscape.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q12: What are sweep representations in solid modeling?</strong><br />
                A12: Sweep representations are used to generate complex 3D shapes by moving a 2D shape (a profile) along a defined path. The shape that results from this movement is called a "sweep" and can be used to model objects like pipes, beams, and threads. The path can be straight or curved, and the profile can change along the path to create more complex forms.
