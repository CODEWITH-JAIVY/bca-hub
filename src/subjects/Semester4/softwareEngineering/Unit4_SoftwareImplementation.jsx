                <h3>Relationship between Design and Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    The design phase provides the blueprint for how the software should be built. Implementation is the process of turning that blueprint into a working system. <br />
                    <strong>Analogy:</strong> If design is the architect's plan for a house, implementation is the construction of the house based on that plan.

                <h3>Implementation Issues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Coding Standards:</strong> Guidelines for how code should be written, improving consistency and readability across a project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Readability:</strong> Writing code that is easy to understand, making it simpler to maintain and debug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reusability:</strong> Designing code so that it can be reused in other parts of the application or in future projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Platform Compatibility:</strong> Ensuring that the software works correctly across different operating systems, browsers, or hardware.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Programming Support Environment</h3>
                <p>Tools that aid in the coding process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):</strong> Tools like Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse provide features like debugging, code completion, and version control integration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Build Automation Tools:</strong> Tools like Maven and Gradle help automate the process of compiling, linking, and packaging the software.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Coding the Procedural Design</h3>
                <p>
                    This is where the design models, like flowcharts or pseudocode, are translated into actual source code using programming languages. <br />
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Turning a data flow diagram into a set of functions and classes.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Good Coding Style</h3>
                <p>Elements that make code more professional and maintainable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Meaningful Variable Names:</strong> Instead of <code>int a;</code>, use <code>int accountBalance;</code> to make code self-explanatory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Proper Indentation:</strong> Clearly structuring code blocks to show the hierarchy and flow of control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Commenting Complex Logic:</strong> Adding comments to explain what the code is doing, particularly in complex areas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Review of Correctness and Readability</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Code Review:</strong> Peer review sessions where team members look over each other's code to find bugs, ensure coding standards are met, and check for overall quality. <br />
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Holding regular review sessions after completing each module to ensure that the code is correct and readable.
