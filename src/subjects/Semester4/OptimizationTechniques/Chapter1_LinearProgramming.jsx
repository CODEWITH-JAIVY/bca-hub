                <strong>Q1: What is linear programming?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical technique used to optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the key components of a linear programming problem?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Key components include the objective function, decision variables, and constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the objective function?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The objective function is a linear expression that represents the goal to be maximized or minimized.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are decision variables?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Decision variables are the variables that can be controlled to achieve the objective, subject to the constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are constraints?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Constraints are linear equalities or inequalities that limit the values of the decision variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are the methods for solving linear programming problems?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Methods include the graphical method and the simplex method.
