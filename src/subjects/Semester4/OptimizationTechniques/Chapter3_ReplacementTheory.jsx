                <strong>Q1: What is replacement theory?</strong>
                <br />

            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the types of replacement problems?</strong>

                <strong>Q3: What are the key factors considered in replacement analysis?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Factors include initial cost, maintenance cost, salvage value, and depreciation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: How do you determine the optimal replacement time for items that deteriorate?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: You determine the optimal time by comparing the average annual cost of owning and operating the equipment for different replacement intervals.
