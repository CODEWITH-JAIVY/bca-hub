      <h2>Unit 3: Vector Calculus</h2>

      {/* Introduction */}
      <p>
        Welcome to the fascinating world of Vector Calculus! In this unit, we'll explore the concepts of differentiating vectors, scalar and vector fields, and the crucial operators: gradient, directional derivative, divergence, and curl. Understanding these concepts is fundamental to many areas of physics and engineering.
      </p>

      {/* 1. Differentiation of Vectors */}
      <h3>1. Differentiation of Vectors</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Vector Differentiation:</strong> Just as we can differentiate scalar functions, we can also differentiate vector-valued functions. A vector-valued function is a function that maps a scalar variable (like time) to a vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function:</strong> If <strong>r</strong>(t) = &lt;x(t), y(t), z(t)&gt; is a vector-valued function, its derivative is defined component-wise:
        <br />
        <strong>r'</strong>(t) = d<strong>r</strong>/dt = &lt;dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt&gt;
        <br/>
        This derivative <strong>r'</strong>(t) represents the tangent vector to the curve traced out by <strong>r</strong>(t) at a given point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> If <strong>r</strong>(t) = &lt;t<sup>2</sup>, sin(t), e<sup>t</sup>&gt;, then <strong>r'</strong>(t) = &lt;2t, cos(t), e<sup>t</sup>&gt;.
      </p>

      {/* 2. Scalar and Vector Fields */}
      <h3>2. Scalar and Vector Fields</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Scalar Field:</strong> A scalar field assigns a scalar value to each point in space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Temperature distribution in a room, density of a material, or electric potential. If T(x, y, z) gives the temperature at point (x,y,z), then T is a scalar field.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Vector Field:</strong> A vector field assigns a vector to each point in space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Velocity of a fluid, gravitational force field, or magnetic field. If <strong>F</strong>(x, y, z) = &lt;P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z)&gt; gives the force at point (x,y,z), then <strong>F</strong> is a vector field.
      </p>

      {/* 3. Gradient */}
      <h3>3. Gradient</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Gradient:</strong> The gradient is an operator that acts on a scalar field and produces a vector field. It represents the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Calculating the Gradient:</strong> If f(x, y, z) is a scalar field, then the gradient of f, denoted by ∇f or grad f, is:
        <br />
        ∇f = &lt;∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Properties of the Gradient:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of f.</li>
          <li>The magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction.</li>
          <li>The gradient is perpendicular to the level surfaces of f.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> If f(x, y, z) = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>, then ∇f = &lt;2x, 2y, 2z&gt;.
      </p>

      {/* 4. Directional Derivatives */}
      <h3>4. Directional Derivatives</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Directional Derivatives:</strong> The directional derivative of a scalar field f in the direction of a unit vector <strong>u</strong> measures the rate of change of f in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Calculating Directional Derivatives:</strong> The directional derivative of f in the direction of <strong>u</strong> is given by:
        <br />
        D<sub><strong>u</strong></sub>f = ∇f ⋅ <strong>u</strong>
        <br/>
        Where <strong>u</strong> = &lt;a,b,c&gt; is a unit vector and ⋅ represents the dot product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Relationship Between Gradient and Directional Derivatives:</strong> The gradient provides a way to compute the directional derivative in any direction. The maximum value of the directional derivative at a point is the magnitude of the gradient.
      </p>
       <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Let f(x, y, z) = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> and <strong>u</strong>= &lt;1/3, 2/3, 2/3&gt;. The D<sub><strong>u</strong></sub>f = &lt;2x, 2y, 2z&gt; ⋅ &lt;1/3, 2/3, 2/3&gt; = (2x/3) + (4y/3) + (4z/3).
      </p>

      {/* 5. Divergence */}
      <h3>5. Divergence</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Divergence:</strong> The divergence is an operator that acts on a vector field and produces a scalar field. It measures the extent to which the vector field is "spreading out" from a given point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Calculating the Divergence:</strong> If <strong>F</strong>(x, y, z) = &lt;P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z), R(x, y, z)&gt; is a vector field, its divergence is:
        <br />
        div <strong>F</strong> = ∇ ⋅ <strong>F</strong> = ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y + ∂R/∂z
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Physical Meaning of Divergence:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Positive divergence at a point indicates a "source" or "outflow" at that point.</li>
          <li>Negative divergence at a point indicates a "sink" or "inflow" at that point.</li>
          <li>Zero divergence at a point means the flow is incompressible.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
       <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Let <strong>F</strong>(x, y, z) = &lt;x, y, z&gt;. div <strong>F</strong> = ∂x/∂x + ∂y/∂y + ∂z/∂z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
      </p>

      {/* 6. Curl */}
      <h3>6. Curl</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Curl:</strong> The curl is an operator that acts on a vector field and produces another vector field. It measures the tendency of the vector field to "rotate" around a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Calculating the Curl:</strong> If <strong>F</strong>(x, y, z) = &lt;P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z), R(x, y, z)&gt; is a vector field, its curl is:
        <br />
        curl <strong>F</strong> = ∇ × <strong>F</strong> = &lt;∂R/∂y - ∂Q/∂z, ∂P/∂z - ∂R/∂x, ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y&gt;
        <br/>
        Which can also be written as a determinant.
        <br/>
        | <strong>i</strong>     <strong>j</strong>     <strong>k</strong>     |
        <br/>
        | ∂/∂x   ∂/∂y   ∂/∂z   |
         <br/>
        |   P        Q       R   |
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Physical Meaning of Curl:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A nonzero curl at a point indicates that the vector field is rotating or circulating around that point.</li>
          <li>The direction of the curl is the axis of rotation, and the magnitude is the amount of rotation.</li>
          <li>Zero curl means the field is irrotational.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Let <strong>F</strong>(x, y, z) = &lt;-y, x, 0&gt;. curl <strong>F</strong> = &lt;0, 0, 2&gt;
      </p>
