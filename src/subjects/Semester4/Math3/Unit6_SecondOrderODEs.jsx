                <h3>1. Homogeneous Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome, students! Today, we're diving into the world of second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We'll start with the basics: homogeneous equations with constant coefficients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition of Homogeneous Linear Equations:</strong>
                    A homogeneous linear ODE of the second order with constant coefficients has the form:
                    <br />
                    <em>ay'' + by' + cy = 0</em>,
                    <br />
                    where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are constants, and <em>y''</em>, <em>y'</em>, and <em>y</em> represent the second derivative, first derivative, and the function itself, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Auxiliary Equation:</strong>
                    To solve this, we form the auxiliary equation by assuming a solution of the form <em>y = e<sup>rx</sup></em>. Substituting this into the ODE and simplifying, we get the auxiliary equation:
                    <br />
                    <em>ar<sup>2</sup> + br + c = 0</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solving Homogeneous Equations:</strong>
                    The roots of the auxiliary equation (<em>r<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>r<sub>2</sub></em>) determine the general solution.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Cases of Complex Roots and Repeated Roots</h3>
                <p>
                    Now let's consider the different scenarios for the roots of the auxiliary equation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Complex Roots:</strong>
                    If the roots are complex (<em>r<sub>1</sub> = α + iβ</em>, <em>r<sub>2</sub> = α - iβ</em>), the general solution is:
                    <br />
                    <em>y = e<sup>αx</sup>(c<sub>1</sub>cos(βx) + c<sub>2</sub>sin(βx))</em>.
                    <br />
                    where <em>c1</em> and <em>c2</em> are constants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Repeated Roots:</strong>
                    If the roots are repeated (<em>r<sub>1</sub> = r<sub>2</sub> = r</em>), the general solution is:
                    <br />
                    <em>y = (c<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>x)e<sup>rx</sup></em>.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Differential Operator</h3>
                <p>
                    The differential operator, denoted by <em>D</em>, is a powerful tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Concept:</strong>
                    We define <em>Dy = y'</em> and <em>D<sup>2</sup>y = y''</em>. Then the equation <em>ay'' + by' + cy = 0</em> can be written as:
                    <br />
                    <em>(aD<sup>2</sup> + bD + c)y = 0</em>.
                    <br/>
                    We can solve this using the auxiliary equation.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Using the Differential Operator to Solve Equations</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The differential operator can be used for more complex equations. For example if we have :
                    <em>(D<sup>2</sup> + 5D + 6)y = 0</em>, to solve it we need to find the roots of the polynom:
                    <em>r<sup>2</sup> + 5r + 6 = 0</em>
                </p>

                <h3>4. Solutions by Methods of Direct Formulae for Particular Integrals</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's now look at non-homogeneous equations: <em>ay'' + by' + cy = f(x)</em>. We need to find a particular integral (<em>y<sub>p</sub></em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Direct Formulae:</strong>
                    For certain forms of <em>f(x)</em>, we have direct formulae:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If <em>f(x) = e<sup>kx</sup></em>, then <em>y<sub>p</sub> = e<sup>kx</sup> / (ak<sup>2</sup> + bk + c)</em>, provided <em>ak<sup>2</sup> + bk + c ≠ 0</em>.</li>
                        <li>If <em>f(x) = sin(kx)</em> or <em>cos(kx)</em>, then use <em>D<sup>2</sup> = -k<sup>2</sup></em>.</li>
                        <li>If <em>f(x) = x<sup>n</sup></em> then <em>y<sub>p</sub></em> can be determined.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

                <h3>5. Solution by Undetermined Coefficients</h3>
                <p>
                    The method of undetermined coefficients is another way to find a particular integral for non-homogeneous equations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Method:</strong>
                    We guess a solution based on the form of <em>f(x)</em> and solve for the unknown coefficients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if <em>f(x)</em> is a polynomial of degree n, guess a polynomial of degree n. If <em>f(x)</em> is of the form <em>e<sup>kx</sup></em>, guess <em>Ae<sup>kx</sup></em>. If <em>f(x)</em> is <em>sin(kx)</em> or <em>cos(kx)</em>, guess <em>Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx)</em>.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Cauchy Differential Equations</h3>
                <p>
                    Cauchy equations have the form <em>ax<sup>2</sup>y'' + bxy' + cy = f(x)</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong>
                    A Cauchy-Euler equation has the form <em>ax<sup>2</sup>y'' + bxy' + cy = f(x)</em> where a,b,c are constant and f(x) is a continuous function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solving Cauchy Equations (Real and Distinct Roots):</strong>
                    We use the substitution <em>x = e<sup>t</sup></em> (or <em>t = ln(x)</em>). This transforms the equation into a constant-coefficient equation.
                    <br/>
                    If the auxiliary equation has real and distinct roots (<em>r1</em> and <em>r2</em>), the solution is:
                     <br/>
                    <em>y = c<sub>1</sub>x<sup>r1</sup> + c<sub>2</sub>x<sup>r2</sup></em>.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h3>7. Operator Method for Finding Particular Integrals</h3>
                <p>
                    Another method for finding particular integrals is using the operator method, which can often simplify the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Using the Operator Method:</strong>
                    We express the equation in operator form and use the inverse operator (1/D) to find the particular integral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: if we have <em>f(D)y = e<sup>ax</sup></em> then, <em>y<sub>p</sub> = 1/f(a) e<sup>ax</sup></em> if <em>f(a) != 0</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Direct Formulae:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If <em>f(x) = e<sup>ax</sup></em> then <em>y<sub>p</sub> = 1/(aD<sup>2</sup> + bD + c) e<sup>ax</sup> = 1/(aa<sup>2</sup> + ba + c) e<sup>ax</sup></em>.</li>
                        <li>If <em>f(x) = sin(ax)</em> or <em>cos(ax)</em> then replace D<sup>2</sup> by -a<sup>2</sup> in <em>1/(aD<sup>2</sup> + bD + c)</em>.</li>
                       
                    </ul>
