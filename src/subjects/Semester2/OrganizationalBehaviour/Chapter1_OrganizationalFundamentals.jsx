                <p>
                    Organizational Behavior (OB) refers to the study of how individuals and groups behave within an organization. 
                    It explores the interaction between people and the organizationâ€™s structure, culture, environment, and systems. 
                    OB seeks to understand and improve the effectiveness of the organization by analyzing behaviors in various organizational contexts.

                <p>
                    Organizational Behavior (OB) is inherently multidisciplinary, drawing concepts from psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, and management. 
                    It is dynamic as behaviors change over time and in response to different internal and external influences.
