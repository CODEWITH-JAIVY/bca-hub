            <h3>6. Leadership Styles</h3>
            <h4>A. Autocratic Leadership</h4>
            <p>
                Autocratic leaders make decisions unilaterally and expect subordinates to follow orders without input or feedback. This style can be effective in situations that require quick decision-making, but it can reduce employee motivation and creativity.
            </p>

            <h4>B. Democratic Leadership</h4>
            <p>
                Democratic leaders encourage participation and input from their team members. This style fosters collaboration and creativity, leading to higher employee satisfaction and commitment. However, decision-making can take longer.
            </p>

            <h4>C. Laissez-Faire Leadership</h4>
            <p>
                Laissez-faire leaders provide minimal supervision and allow team members to make decisions independently. This style works best when team members are highly skilled and self-motivated, but it can lead to a lack of direction and accountability.
            </p>

            <h4>D. Transformational Leadership</h4>
            <p>
                Transformational leaders inspire and motivate their team by creating a compelling vision, providing individualized support, and encouraging innovation. This style fosters a positive work culture and drives long-term success through personal growth and development.
            </p>
