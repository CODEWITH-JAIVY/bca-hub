            <h3>1. Perception</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> Perception is the process by which individuals interpret and make sense of the world around them. It's how we see and understand things, events, people, and situations, influenced by our senses, experiences, beliefs, and emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Nature:</strong> Perception is subjective, selective, and dynamic, meaning it varies from person to person, focuses on certain aspects, and can change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Process of Perception:</strong>
                <br />
                1. <strong>Stimulation:</strong> The process begins when a stimulus (something you see, hear, or feel) is detected by your senses.
                <br />
                2. <strong>Organization:</strong> The brain processes the stimulus and organizes it into a coherent pattern or meaningful structure.
                <br />
                3. <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Finally, we interpret the stimulus based on our knowledge, values, and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance in Organizational Behavior:</strong> Perception shapes how employees react to events, people, and policies within an organization. Managers must understand perception to manage employees' attitudes and behaviors effectively.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Attitude</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> Attitude is an individual's predisposition to respond positively or negatively toward certain objects, people, or situations. It is formed based on our experiences, beliefs, and perceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Nature of Attitude:</strong>
                <br />
                - <strong>Cognitive Component:</strong> What a person believes or thinks about a particular object or person.
                <br />
                - <strong>Affective Component:</strong> The feelings or emotions a person has toward an object or person.
                <br />
                - <strong>Behavioral Component:</strong> The way a person behaves or intends to behave in response to the attitude.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Effects of Employee Attitudes:</strong> Positive attitudes towards work lead to higher job satisfaction, improved performance, and better organizational commitment. Negative attitudes can lead to job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, and turnover.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Values</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> Values are deeply held beliefs about what is right and wrong, important, and worthwhile. They guide individuals' behavior and decision-making processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personal vs Organizational Values:</strong>
                <br />
                - <strong>Personal Values:</strong> These are individual beliefs and principles that guide a person’s behavior, such as the importance of family, health, or career success.
                <br />
                - <strong>Organizational Values:</strong> These are the guiding principles or standards that an organization stands for, such as integrity, teamwork, customer orientation, and social responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Impact on Organizational Behavior:</strong> When personal values align with organizational values, employees are more likely to be motivated, engaged, and committed to the organization.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and sustains goal-directed behavior. It’s the force that drives individuals to achieve their goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Nature of Motivation:</strong>
                <br />
                - <strong>Intrinsic Motivation:</strong> Comes from within the individual, driven by personal satisfaction, growth, and development.
                <br />
                - <strong>Extrinsic Motivation:</strong> Comes from external rewards or pressures such as money, promotions, or praise from others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance in the Workplace:</strong> Motivation leads to increased productivity, job satisfaction, and employee retention.
            </p>

            <h3>Motivational Theories</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</h4>
            <p>
                Maslow’s theory proposes that human beings are motivated by a hierarchy of needs that must be satisfied in a specific order:
                <br />
                1. Physiological Needs (Basic survival)
                <br />
                2. Safety Needs (Security, health)
                <br />
                3. Social Needs (Belonging, relationships)
                <br />
                4. Esteem Needs (Recognition, respect)
                <br />
                5. Self-Actualization (Personal growth)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Implications:</strong> Managers should address lower-level needs before expecting employees to focus on higher-level needs like self-fulfillment.
            </p>

            <h4>2. McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Theory X:</strong> Assumes that employees are lazy, dislike work, and need to be closely supervised.
                <br />
                <strong>Theory Y:</strong> Assumes that employees are self-motivated, enjoy work, and can take responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Implications:</strong> Theory Y managers foster a more collaborative work environment, leading to better employee engagement.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory</h4>
            <p>
                Herzberg proposed two factors influencing job satisfaction:
                <br />
                - Hygiene Factors (salary, job security, working conditions)
                <br />
                - Motivators (achievement, recognition, personal growth)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Implications:</strong> Managers must ensure hygiene factors are addressed to avoid dissatisfaction but also focus on motivators for job satisfaction.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Expectancy Theory</h4>
            <p>
                Expectancy theory suggests that employees are motivated when they believe their efforts will lead to good performance, which will then lead to rewards they value.
                <br />
                - Expectancy: The belief that effort will lead to desired performance.
                <br />
                - Instrumentality: The belief that performance will lead to desired rewards.
                <br />
                - Valence: The value placed on the rewards by the employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Implications:</strong> Managers must ensure that employees believe in the link between effort, performance, and rewards.
            </p>
