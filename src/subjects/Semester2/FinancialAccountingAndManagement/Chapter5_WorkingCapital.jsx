            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is working capital?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Working capital is the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities. It is a measure of a company's short-term financial health and operational efficiency. Positive working capital indicates that a company can cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets, while negative working capital may indicate liquidity problems.

            <p>
                <strong>Concept & Components of Working Capital:</strong>
                <br />
                Working capital is a critical indicator of a company's short-term financial health and operational efficiency. It is essential for ensuring a company has enough funds to operate smoothly. The main components of working capital include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> These are assets that can be quickly converted to cash or used within one year, such as cash, receivables, and inventory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> These are obligations that must be settled within one year, such as short-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.</li>
                </ul>
                The difference between current assets and current liabilities determines a company's working capital.

                <strong>Factors Influencing the Composition of Working Capital:</strong>
                <br />
                The composition of working capital is influenced by a number of internal and external factors, including:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nature of the Business:</strong> Capital-intensive businesses, such as manufacturing, often require more working capital due to high inventory and receivables. Service-based companies may have lower working capital needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Cycle:</strong> Companies in industries with longer operating cycles (e.g., construction) need more working capital to finance operations, while businesses with shorter cycles may require less.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Policy:</strong> Companies that offer generous credit terms to customers may see an increase in accounts receivable and thus need more working capital.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> Businesses that experience seasonal fluctuations in sales may need more working capital during peak seasons and less during off-seasons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Conditions:</strong> Economic factors, such as inflation or interest rates, can affect a company’s ability to borrow or the cost of financing, which in turn influences working capital requirements.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Objectives of Working Capital Management – Liquidity vs. Profitability:</strong>
                <br />
                The primary objective of working capital management is to maintain a balance between liquidity and profitability. There are two main goals:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Ensuring the company has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations and avoid financial distress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Ensuring that the company uses its resources efficiently to generate profit. Having too much working capital can lead to inefficiencies, while too little can lead to missed opportunities and financial risk.</li>
                </ul>
                The challenge for financial managers is to strike a balance between these two objectives. Excessive working capital can lead to inefficient use of resources, while insufficient working capital can lead to liquidity problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Working Capital Policies:</strong>
                <br />
                Companies adopt different working capital policies based on their needs and risk tolerance. The three primary types of working capital policies are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aggressive Policy:</strong> Under this policy, companies minimize their working capital to maximize profitability, relying on short-term financing. This approach increases risk but can yield higher returns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conservative Policy:</strong> In this policy, companies maintain a high level of working capital to ensure liquidity and minimize risk. This approach is safer but may result in lower profitability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moderate Policy:</strong> Companies adopting a moderate policy maintain a balance between risk and return by keeping a reasonable amount of working capital.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Theory of Working Capital – Nature and Concepts:</strong>
                <br />
                The theory of working capital revolves around the idea that a company’s short-term financial health and operational efficiency depend on managing its working capital effectively. Key concepts include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Operating Cycle:</strong> The time taken for a company to convert its raw materials into cash through the sale of finished goods. A shorter operating cycle is favorable for working capital management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Cycle:</strong> The time between outlaying cash for inventory and receiving cash from sales. A shorter cash cycle indicates efficient working capital management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financing Working Capital:</strong> A company must decide how to finance its working capital, either through short-term borrowings or retained earnings. The method chosen depends on the company’s risk tolerance and the stability of its cash flows.</li>
                </ul>
