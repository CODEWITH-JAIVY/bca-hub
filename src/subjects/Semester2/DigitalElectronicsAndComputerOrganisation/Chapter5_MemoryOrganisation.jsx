                Chapter 5: Memory Organisation
            </h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is memory organisation?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Memory organisation refers to how memory is structured and managed in a computer system to efficiently store and retrieve data. 
                It involves different layers or levels of memory, from the fastest cache memory to the slowest secondary storage. Each type of memory serves specific purposes in terms of speed, capacity, and cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the different levels of memory hierarchy?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: The memory hierarchy consists of several levels, each with different speeds and sizes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cache Memory</strong>: Fastest memory located closest to the CPU. It stores frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.</li>
                    <li><strong>Main Memory (RAM)</strong>: Primary memory used by the CPU during program execution. It is larger but slower than cache memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Storage</strong>: Includes devices like hard drives and SSDs, which provide large storage capacities but are slower than both cache and RAM.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the purpose of cache memory in memory organisation?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Cache memory stores frequently accessed data to improve the speed of data retrieval, reducing the average time to access memory. 
                The CPU accesses data from cache much faster than from RAM. Cache memory acts as a buffer between the CPU and main memory, reducing latency.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are the different cache mapping techniques?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Cache mapping techniques are methods used to map the data from main memory into cache memory. These techniques include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct Mapping</strong>: Each block of main memory is mapped to exactly one cache line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Associative Mapping</strong>: A block of main memory can be stored in any cache line, and the cache controller uses tags to find the correct block.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set-Associative Mapping</strong>: Combines both direct and associative mapping, where the cache is divided into multiple sets, and a block of memory can be stored in any line of a specific set.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is virtual memory?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows programs to access more memory than is physically available in RAM. It uses a portion of the hard drive or SSD as "virtual" memory. The operating system moves data between RAM and disk storage to create the illusion of a larger memory space.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is memory segmentation?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Memory segmentation involves dividing memory into logical segments, each with a base address and a limit. 
                Segmentation is used to manage the memory more efficiently and to provide better memory protection, as each segment can have different access permissions (read, write, execute).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What is memory paging?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: Memory paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks called pages. These pages are stored in non-contiguous locations in physical memory, allowing for more efficient use of available space. When a program accesses memory, the operating system translates virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses through a page table.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q8: What is the basic cell of Static and Dynamic RAM?</strong>
                <br />
                A8: The basic cell in RAM refers to the smallest unit of memory in a memory array:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Static RAM (SRAM)</strong>: Each memory cell uses a flip-flop to store a bit of data. SRAM is faster and more reliable but consumes more power and takes up more space than dynamic RAM.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</strong>: Each memory cell stores data in a capacitor. DRAM is cheaper and has a higher storage density but requires periodic refreshing to retain data. It is slower than SRAM but more cost-effective for larger memory capacities.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q9: How are large memories built using chips?</strong>
                <br />
                A9: Large memory systems are built by connecting multiple memory chips together. A memory chip consists of an array of memory cells. By stacking chips together, the memory system can be scaled to provide a larger capacity. These chips are connected via multiplexers and address decoders to enable efficient access to data stored in each chip. 
                The system can be designed in a way that the CPU can access any memory location seamlessly, even if it is distributed across multiple chips.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q10: What is associative memory?</strong>
                <br />
                A10: Associative memory, also known as content-addressable memory (CAM), is a type of memory where data is accessed based on its content rather than its address. 
                In associative memory, the memory module returns the address of a data item when a part of its content is provided, making it faster for searching data.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q11: How is cache memory organized?</strong>
                <br />
                A11: Cache memory is organized in a hierarchy with multiple levels:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>L1 Cache</strong>: This is the smallest and fastest cache, located directly on the CPU chip.</li>
                    <li><strong>L2 Cache</strong>: This cache is slower than L1 but larger and is located either on the CPU chip or near the CPU.</li>
                    <li><strong>L3 Cache</strong>: This is the largest and slowest cache, typically shared among multiple CPU cores.</li>
                </ul>
                Cache memory works by storing frequently accessed data and instructions so that the CPU can retrieve them quickly, minimizing the time spent accessing the slower main memory.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Q12: How is virtual memory organized?</strong>
                <br />
                A12: Virtual memory is managed using a combination of hardware (MMU) and software (OS). It relies on a page table that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses in RAM. 
                When a program accesses a memory location that is not currently in physical memory, a page fault occurs, and the operating system loads the required page from secondary storage (disk) into RAM. 
                This allows programs to use more memory than is physically available by swapping data in and out of RAM as needed.
