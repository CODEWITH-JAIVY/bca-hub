                <strong>Q1: What is computer memory?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Computer memory is a storage space in a computer system used to store data and instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the different types of computer memory?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Types include RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM (Read-Only Memory), cache memory, and secondary storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is RAM?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: RAM is a type of volatile memory used to store data and instructions that the CPU is actively using.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are the types of RAM?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Types include SRAM (Static RAM) and DRAM (Dynamic RAM).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is ROM?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: ROM is a type of non-volatile memory that stores data permanently, typically used for storing firmware and boot instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are the types of ROM?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Types include PROM (Programmable ROM), EPROM (Erasable PROM), and EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What is cache memory?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: Cache memory is a small, fast memory used to store frequently accessed data, improving the speed of data retrieval.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q8: What is secondary storage?</strong>
                <br />
                A8: Secondary storage is non-volatile memory used for long-term storage of data, such as hard drives, SSDs, and USB drives.
