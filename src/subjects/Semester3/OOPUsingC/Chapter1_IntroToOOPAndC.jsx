                <p className="mb-4">
                    This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the C++ programming language. OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. C++ is a versatile language that fully supports OOP along with other paradigms, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). OOP emphasizes the organization of software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Advantages of OOP</h4>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Objects can be created independently, making code easier to manage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Inheritance allows new objects to be created from existing ones, saving development time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, increasing code flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effective Problem Solving:</strong> OOP maps well to real-world entities, making it easier to solve complex problems.</li>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Key Principles of OOP</h3>

                {/* Encapsulation */}
                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">1. Encapsulation</h4>
                <p className="mb-2">
                    Encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class. It also involves hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> Encapsulation enhances data security by controlling access to the data and improves code organization by grouping related data and methods.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'><strong>Example:</strong> A `Car` class can encapsulate attributes like `model` and `color`, along with methods like `start()` and `drive()`. Users interact with the car through methods, not directly with the attributes.</p>

                {/* Inheritance */}
                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">2. Inheritance</h4>
                <p className="mb-2">
                    Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or parent class).
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Base Class:</strong> The existing class from which new classes inherit.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Derived Class:</strong> The new class that inherits properties and behaviors from the base class.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Inheritance promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A `SportsCar` class can inherit from a `Car` class, gaining common features while adding specialized ones like `turbo`.
                </p>

                {/* Polymorphism */}
                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">3. Polymorphism</h4>
                <p className="mb-2">
                    Polymorphism is the ability of a single interface to represent different types or classes, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Compile-time Polymorphism:</strong> Achieved through function overloading and operator overloading, allowing multiple functions or operators to have the same name but with different parameters.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Runtime Polymorphism:</strong> Achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> Polymorphism increases code flexibility and extensibility.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A `draw()` method can be implemented differently in `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes, yet all can be called using the same `draw()` interface.
                </p>

                {/* Abstraction */}
                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">4. Abstraction</h4>
                <p className="mb-2">
                    Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential attributes and behaviors, hiding unnecessary details.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Abstract Classes and Interfaces:</strong> Used to define common interfaces without providing a full implementation.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> Abstraction simplifies system design by focusing on essential features.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                <strong>Example:</strong> An `Animal` abstract class might define a `makeSound()` method without implementation, leaving each specific animal class (like `Dog` or `Cat`) to implement its own unique sound.
                </p>
            </section>

            {/* C++ */}
            <section className="mb-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">C++</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. C++ builds on the strengths of C, such as its efficiency and low-level control, while adding powerful OOP features.
                </p>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">C++ Paradigms</h4>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> C++ supports procedural programming, allowing the use of functions and structured programming techniques.</li>

                    <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> C++ is used to develop operating systems due to its performance and low-level access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> C++ is a popular choice for game development due to its speed and control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> C++ is used in embedded systems where performance is critical.</li>

               Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q3: What is encapsulation?</strong><br />
               Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a class, hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.
