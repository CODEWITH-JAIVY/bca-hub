            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is a stack?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the basic operations of a stack?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Basic operations include push (add an element), pop (remove an element), peek (view the top element), and isEmpty (check if the stack is empty).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is a queue?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are the basic operations of a queue?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Basic operations include enqueue (add an element), dequeue (remove an element), front (view the front element), and isEmpty (check if the queue is empty).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: How can a stack be implemented?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: A stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: How can a queue be implemented?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: A queue can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What are the applications of stacks?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: Applications include expression evaluation, function call management, and backtracking algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q8: What are the applications of queues?</strong>
                <br />
                A8: Applications include task scheduling, print queue management, and breadth-first search algorithms.
