            <h2>Chapter 6: Sorting and Searching</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is sorting?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are common sorting algorithms?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is bubble sort?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is selection sort?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is insertion sort?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly inserting the next element into the correct position.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is searching?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Searching is the process of finding a specific element in a data structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What are common searching algorithms?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: Algorithms include linear search and binary search.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q8: What is linear search?</strong>
                <br />
                A8: Linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q9: What is binary search?</strong>
                <br />
                A9: Binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half, suitable for sorted lists.
            </p>
