                <strong>Q1: What is a linked list?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains a data part and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the different types of linked lists?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Types include singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is a singly linked list?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: A singly linked list is a linked list where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is a doubly linked list?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: A doubly linked list is a linked list where each node points to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is a circular linked list?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are the basic operations of a linked list?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Basic operations include insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What are the advantages of using linked lists?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: Advantages include dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion and deletion of elements, and no fixed size limitations.
