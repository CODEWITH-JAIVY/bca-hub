                <strong>Q1: What is probability?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What is an event?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: An event is a set of outcomes of an experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is sample space?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is the formula for calculating probability?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Probability of an event A is P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are independent events?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Independent events are events whose outcomes do not affect each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are dependent events?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Dependent events are events where the outcome of one event affects the outcome of another event.
