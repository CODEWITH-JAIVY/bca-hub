                <strong>Q1: What is dispersion?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Dispersion refers to the extent to which numerical data is spread about its average value.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the measures of dispersion?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Measures include range, variance, standard deviation, and quartile deviation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the range?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is variance?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean, indicating the average squared deviation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is standard deviation?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of the spread of the data around the mean.
