                <strong>Q1: What is a microprocessor?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: A microprocessor is a computer processor on a microchip. It contains the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, and registers necessary to execute instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the key components of a microprocessor?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Key components include the ALU, control unit, registers, cache memory, and system bus interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the function of the ALU in a microprocessor?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is the function of the control unit in a microprocessor?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: The control unit fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and coordinates the execution of these instructions by other microprocessor components.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are the different types of microprocessors?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Types include CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) microprocessors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is a CISC microprocessor?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: CISC microprocessors have a large set of complex instructions, allowing for more complex operations to be performed with fewer instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What is a RISC microprocessor?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: RISC microprocessors have a smaller set of simple instructions, requiring more instructions to perform complex operations but typically executing faster.
