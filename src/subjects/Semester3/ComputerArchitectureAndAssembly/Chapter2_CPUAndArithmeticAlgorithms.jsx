                <strong>Q1: What is the structure of a CPU?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: The CPU typically consists of the control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), registers, and cache memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What is the role of the control unit?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: The control unit fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and coordinates the execution of these instructions by other CPU components.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the ALU?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are registers?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU used to hold data and instructions that are being actively processed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are common arithmetic algorithms?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Algorithms include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are implemented using binary arithmetic operations.
