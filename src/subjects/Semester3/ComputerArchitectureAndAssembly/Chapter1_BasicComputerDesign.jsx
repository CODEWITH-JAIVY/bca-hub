                <strong>Q1: What is computer architecture?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Computer architecture is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the main components of a computer system?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: The main components include the CPU, memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and the system bus.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the function of the CPU?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is the role of memory in a computer system?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Memory stores data and instructions that the CPU can access quickly, including RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are I/O devices?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: I/O devices allow the computer to interact with the external world, including input devices (keyboard, mouse) and output devices (monitor, printer).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is the system bus?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: The system bus is a set of wires that connects the CPU, memory, and I/O devices, allowing them to communicate and transfer data.
