            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is assembly language?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses symbolic representations of machine code instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What is an assembler?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code into machine code.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What are the basic components of an assembly language program?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Components include instructions, directives, labels, and comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are assembly language instructions?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Instructions are commands that the microprocessor executes, such as data transfer, arithmetic operations, and control flow instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are assembly language directives?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Directives are commands that provide instructions to the assembler, such as defining data segments and reserving memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are assembly language labels?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Labels are symbolic names assigned to memory locations or instructions, used to reference these locations in the code.
