            <p>
                <strong>Q1: What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data (attributes) and code (methods) to manipulate that data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the key principles of OOP?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is encapsulation?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a class, hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is inheritance?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or parent class).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is polymorphism?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Polymorphism is the ability of a single interface to represent different types or classes, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is abstraction?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential attributes and behaviors, hiding unnecessary details.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q7: What is C++?</strong>
                <br />
                A7: C++ is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.
