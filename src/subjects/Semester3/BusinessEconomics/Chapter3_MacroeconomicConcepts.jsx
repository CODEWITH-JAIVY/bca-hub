            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. What is Macroeconomics?</h3>
            <p>
                Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. It focuses on large-scale economic factors such as national income, overall employment, inflation, and growth. It helps policymakers and governments in managing economic stability and development.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Key Macroeconomic Indicators</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>GDP (Gross Domestic Product):</strong> Measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country during a specific period.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Measures the rate at which prices rise and purchasing power falls.</li>
                <li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> Percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively seeking work.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Cost of borrowing money, which affects savings, investment, and consumption.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Inflation</h3>
            <p>
                Inflation is the rise in the general price level over time. It reduces the purchasing power of money.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Types:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Demand-Pull Inflation:</strong> When demand exceeds supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Push Inflation:</strong> Due to rising costs of production.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Measured by:</strong> Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI).</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Unemployment</h3>
            <p>
                Unemployment occurs when individuals willing to work at the current wage rate cannot find jobs.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Types of Unemployment:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Frictional:</strong> Temporary, between jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural:</strong> Mismatch of skills and jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclical:</strong> Due to economic downturns.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal:</strong> Due to seasonal demand changes (e.g., agriculture).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Trade Cycles</h3>
            <p>
                Also known as business cycles, trade cycles refer to the fluctuations in economic activity over time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Phases of Trade Cycle:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Rising GDP, employment, income.</li>
                <li><strong>Peak:</strong> Economy at maximum output.</li>
                <li><strong>Contraction:</strong> Decline in output and employment.</li>
                <li><strong>Trough:</strong> Lowest point of economic activity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Circular Flow of Income â€“ Four Sector Economy</h3>
            <p>
                The circular flow of income shows how money moves through the economy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sectors Involved:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Households:</strong> Provide factors of production and consume goods/services.</li>
                <li><strong>Firms:</strong> Produce goods/services and pay wages, rent, profit, interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Government:</strong> Collects taxes and provides public goods, services, subsidies.</li>
                <li><strong>Foreign Sector:</strong> Engages in trade (exports and imports).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Money flows from households to firms as payment for goods. Firms pay households income. Government and foreign trade affect this flow via taxes, spending, exports, and imports.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. Role of Government in Macroeconomy</h3>
            <p>The government plays a crucial role in stabilizing and guiding the economy using two key policies:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Fiscal Policy:</strong> Managed by the Ministry of Finance</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Involves government spending and taxation.</li>
                <li>Expansionary Fiscal Policy is used during a recession (increase spending or cut taxes).</li>
                <li>Contractionary Fiscal Policy is used to control inflation (reduce spending or increase taxes).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Monetary Policy:</strong> Managed by the Central Bank (e.g., RBI in India)</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Involves control of money supply and interest rates.</li>
                <li>Used to control inflation and maintain liquidity in the economy.</li>
                <li>Instruments include Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, CRR, and SLR.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">8. Measuring National Income and Output</h3>
            <p>National income is the total income earned by a country's residents and businesses, including any income from abroad.</p>
            <p><strong>Three Methods:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>1. Product/Output Method:</strong> Measures value of goods/services produced.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Income Method:</strong> Adds up all incomes (wages, rents, profits, interest).</li>
                <li><strong>3. Expenditure Method:</strong> Adds all spending on final goods/services (C + I + G + NX).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> All three methods should yield the same national income if data is accurate.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">9. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding macroeconomic concepts helps in analyzing the health of an economy and formulating policies for sustainable development. These concepts are vital for economists, government officials, and informed citizens.
