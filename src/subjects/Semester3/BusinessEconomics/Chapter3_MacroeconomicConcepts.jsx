        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">1. What is Macroeconomics?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. It focuses on
          large-scale economic factors such as national income, overall
          employment, inflation, and growth. It helps policymakers and
          governments in managing economic stability and development.
          Understanding macroeconomics is crucial for businesses as it provides
          insights into the overall health and direction of the economy,
          allowing them to make informed decisions.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>GDP (Gross Domestic Product):</strong> Measures the total
            value of goods and services produced in a country during a specific
            period. A growing GDP indicates a healthy economy, which is good for
            businesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inflation:</strong> Measures the rate at which prices rise and
            purchasing power falls. High inflation can erode profits and
            increase costs for businesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> Percentage of the labor force that
            is jobless and actively seeking work. High unemployment can reduce
            consumer spending.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Cost of borrowing money, which affects
            savings, investment, and consumption. High interest rates can make
            business expansion more expensive.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Inflation is the rise in the general price level over time. It reduces
          the purchasing power of money and can significantly impact businesses'
          costs and revenues.

          <li>
            <strong>Cost-Push Inflation:</strong> Due to rising costs of

          Unemployment occurs when individuals willing to work at the current
          wage rate cannot find jobs. It's a critical indicator of economic
          health, affecting labor availability and consumer spending.

          <li>
            Expansionary Fiscal Policy is used during a recession (increase

          </li>
          <li>
            Contractionary Fiscal Policy is used to control inflation (reduce

        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>2. Monetary Policy:</strong> Managed by the Central Bank (e.g.,

        <p className="mb-4">
          National income is the total income earned by a country's residents
          and businesses, including any income from abroad. It helps to measure
          the value of the economy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Three Methods:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Product/Output Method:</strong> Measures value of
            goods/services produced.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Income Method:</strong> Adds up all incomes (wages, rents,
            profits, interest).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Expenditure Method:</strong> Adds all spending on final
            goods/services (C + I + G + NX).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Note:</strong> All three methods should yield the same
          national income if data is accurate.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Understanding macroeconomic concepts helps in analyzing the health of
