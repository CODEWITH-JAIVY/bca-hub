          Introduction to the Global Economy
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The global economy encompasses the economic activities that occur
          between multiple countries. It includes international trade, foreign
          investments, capital flows, and labor migration. The world economy is
          increasingly interconnected, meaning that economic events in one
          country can significantly affect other countries.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">International Trade</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          International trade is the exchange of goods and services across
          national borders. Countries trade to access resources they lack or to
          specialize in producing goods and services where they have a
          comparative advantage. This exchange is facilitated by different
          payment methods and currencies, which leads us to foreign exchange.

      {/* Foreign Exchange */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Foreign Exchange</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Foreign exchange refers to the currencies of other countries that are
          used in international trade. The foreign exchange market facilitates
          the conversion of one currency into another, which is essential for
          international transactions. The value of a currency relative to
          another is determined by supply and demand in this market.

          Role of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The World Trade Organization (WTO) is a global body that governs
          international trade rules. Established in 1995, it evolved from the
          General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The WTO aims to ensure
          that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible. It
          achieves this through administering trade agreements, acting as a
          forum for trade negotiations, and resolving trade disputes.

          Impact of the World Economy on Businesses
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The global economy significantly impacts businesses. International
          trade allows businesses to access larger markets and cheaper
          resources. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations can affect the cost of
          imports and exports, impacting a company's profit margins. The WTO
          creates a stable environment for trade, which benefits businesses by
          reducing uncertainty and promoting fair competition.
