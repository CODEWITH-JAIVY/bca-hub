            <h3>1. The Scope and Method of Economics</h3>
            <p>
                Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices to allocate scarce resources to satisfy their needs and wants. 
                The scope of economics is wide, covering two main areas:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Microeconomics:</strong> Focuses on individual markets, firms, and consumer behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Macroeconomics:</strong> Looks at the economy as a whole, considering issues like national income, inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.</li>
                </ul>
                Economists use theoretical models to understand economic phenomena, test hypotheses, and make predictions. These models are often based on assumptions about human behavior, such as rational decision-making. Economists also rely on empirical data to analyze past trends and inform future forecasts.
                <br />
                The methods used in economics include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Studying real-world economic events and behaviors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypothesis testing:</strong> Using data to test the validity of economic theories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematical models:</strong> Creating equations and systems to explain relationships between economic variables.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>2. The Economic Problem: Scarcity & Choice</h3>
            <p>
                Scarcity is the fundamental problem in economics. Resources are limited (land, labor, capital), but human desires are virtually unlimited. This gap between limited resources and unlimited wants forces individuals and societies to make choices about how to allocate resources.
                <br />
                <strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> is the cost of choosing one option over another, representing the value of the next best alternative that must be forgone. 
                Economic decisions are fundamentally about managing scarcity. Societies and individuals must decide what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it, making opportunity cost a central concept in decision-making.
            </p>

            <h3>3. The Price Mechanism</h3>
            <p>
                The price mechanism is the system in which prices of goods and services are determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a competitive market.
                <br />
                When demand increases for a product (e.g., due to consumer preferences or scarcity), and supply remains unchanged, the price typically rises. Higher prices encourage producers to increase production.
                When demand decreases, prices fall, signaling producers to reduce output.
                <br />
                The price mechanism helps allocate resources efficiently. Prices act as signals to both producers and consumers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Consumers use prices to decide what to buy.</li>
                    <li>Producers adjust production based on the prices they can charge for goods and services.</li>
                </ul>
                This mechanism ensures that resources are allocated to their most valued uses based on market conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Demand and Supply Equilibrium</h3>
            <p>
                Equilibrium in a market occurs when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a particular price. This is the point at which there is neither a surplus nor a shortage in the market.
                <br />
                <strong>Demand:</strong> The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at different prices.
                <br />
                <strong>Supply:</strong> The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at different prices.
                <br />
                At equilibrium:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Price stability:</strong> The price at which supply equals demand is stable.</li>
                </ul>
                If the market is out of equilibrium, market forces will push the price back toward equilibrium:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shortage (demand  {'>'} supply):</strong> Prices will rise, prompting producers to supply more and consumers to buy less.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surplus (supply  {'>'}demand):</strong> Prices will fall, prompting consumers to buy more and producers to reduce supply.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>5. The Concept of Elasticity and its Applications</h3>
            <p>
                Elasticity measures the responsiveness of one variable (such as quantity demanded or supplied) to a change in another variable (such as price or income).
                <br />
                <strong>Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):</strong> Measures how much the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to a price change.
                <ul>
                    <li>If PED {'>'} 1 (elastic), demand is sensitive to price changes (e.g., luxury goods).</li>
                    <li>If PED  {'>'} 1 (inelastic), demand is less sensitive to price changes (e.g., necessities).</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Price Elasticity of Supply (PES):</strong> Measures how much the quantity supplied of a good changes in response to a price change.
                <br />
                <strong>Income Elasticity of Demand (YED):</strong> Measures how the demand for a good changes as consumer incomes change.
                <br />
                Applications of elasticity:
                <ul>
                    <li>Helps firms set pricing strategies based on how sensitive consumers are to price changes.</li>
                    <li>Used in tax policy to predict the effects of taxes on the supply and demand of goods.</li>
                    <li>Aids in understanding consumer behavior and preferences, particularly in competitive markets.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>6. The Production Process: Output Decisions</h3>
            <p>
                The production process involves converting inputs (such as raw materials, labor, and capital) into outputs (finished goods and services).
                <br />
                Key decisions in production include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revenues:</strong> Income from selling goods and services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Expenses incurred during production, including fixed costs (e.g., rent) and variable costs (e.g., materials).</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong> Firms aim to produce at a level where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). This ensures that the firm is maximizing its profit by producing the optimal quantity of goods.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>7. Laws of Returns and Returns to Scale</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Laws of Returns:</strong> These describe how the quantity of output changes when additional units of a variable input (such as labor) are added while other inputs remain constant.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increasing Returns:</strong> Output increases at an increasing rate as more of the variable input is used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constant Returns:</strong> Output increases at a constant rate with the addition of more input.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decreasing Returns:</strong> Output increases at a decreasing rate with additional input.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Returns to Scale:</strong> Describes how output changes when all inputs are increased proportionally.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increasing Returns to Scale:</strong> Output increases by a larger proportion than inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constant Returns to Scale:</strong> Output increases in proportion to inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decreasing Returns to Scale:</strong> Output increases by a smaller proportion than inputs.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>8. Economies and Diseconomies of Scale</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Economies of Scale:</strong> Occur when a firmâ€™s long-run average costs decrease as its level of production increases. This can happen due to factors like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Specialization of labor and equipment.</li>
                    <li>Bulk purchasing of materials.</li>
                    <li>Greater use of technology.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Diseconomies of Scale:</strong> Arise when a firm becomes too large and its per-unit costs increase due to inefficiencies in management, coordination, and logistics.
