      <h2>Chapter 5: Vector Algebra</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Q1: What is a vector?</strong>
        <br />
        A1: A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q2: How do you represent a vector?</strong>
        <br />
        A2: Vectors can be represented in component form (e.g., (x, y, z)) or using unit vectors (i, j, k).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3: How do you perform vector addition and subtraction?</strong>
        <br />
        A3: Vector addition and subtraction are performed component-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q4: What is the dot product of two vectors?</strong>
        <br />
        A4: The dot product (scalar product) of two vectors a and b is |a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between the vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q5: What is the cross product of two vectors?</strong>
        <br />
        A5: The cross product (vector product) of two vectors a and b is a vector perpendicular to both a and b, with magnitude |a||b|sinθ.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q6: What are the applications of vector algebra?</strong>
        <br />
        A6: Applications include physics, engineering, and computer graphics.
