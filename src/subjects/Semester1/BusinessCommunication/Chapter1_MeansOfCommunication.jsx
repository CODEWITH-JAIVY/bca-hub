        <p className="mb-4">
          Communication is the process of sharing information, thoughts, and feelings between people. 
          It can be classified into several types based on how the message is delivered or received.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q1: What are the different means of communication?</strong>
          <br />
          A1: Communication can be categorized as:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li><strong>Verbal Communication:</strong> Spoken words (face-to-face, phone calls, meetings).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-verbal Communication:</strong> Body language, gestures, posture, facial expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Written Communication:</strong> Emails, letters, reports, texts.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Communication:</strong> Use of charts, diagrams, logos, and graphics.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q2: Explain verbal communication.</strong>
          <br />
          A2: Verbal communication involves the use of spoken language. It's commonly used in face-to-face discussions,
          meetings, and phone conversations. Clarity of speech, tone, and active listening are critical for effective verbal communication.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q3: What does non-verbal communication entail?</strong>
          <br />
          A3: Non-verbal communication involves using physical behaviors to convey messages without words.
          This includes facial expressions (smiling, frowning), gestures (nodding, hand movements), posture, and eye contact.
          It often complements verbal communication and helps in understanding emotions and intent.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q4: What are the advantages of written communication?</strong>
          <br />
          A4: Written communication provides a permanent and verifiable record of messages. It's useful for
          detailed instructions, legal documents, formal reports, and professional emails. It helps avoid misunderstandings
          and is ideal when complex ideas need to be conveyed clearly.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q5: How is visual communication used in business?</strong>
          <br />
          A5: Visual communication uses elements like infographics, graphs, charts, and icons to present data
          and messages in an understandable and engaging format. It enhances retention and helps simplify complex information.
