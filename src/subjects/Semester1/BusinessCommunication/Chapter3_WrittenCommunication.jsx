      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="mb-4">
        Written communication refers to the transmission of messages through written symbols (letters, emails, texts, reports, etc.). 
        It is crucial in professional, academic, and personal contexts, where permanent records, clarity, and professionalism are essential.

          <strong>Q1: What are the key elements of effective written communication?</strong>
          <br />
          A1: The 5 Cs of written communication are essential for delivering impactful messages:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Message should be simple, unambiguous, and to the point.</li>
            <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> Say more with fewer words without losing meaning.</li>
            <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Free from grammatical, spelling, and factual errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Coherence:</strong> Logically organized so each idea flows smoothly to the next.</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> All required details should be present to avoid confusion or follow-up questions.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <strong>Q2: How does clarity affect written messages?</strong>
          <br />
          A2: Clarity avoids confusion. Use simple language, define complex terms, and structure sentences clearly.
          Avoid jargon when writing for a general audience.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q3: Why is conciseness important in written communication?</strong>
          <br />
          A3: Conciseness shows respect for the readerâ€™s time. Unnecessary words dilute your main idea. Focus on what truly matters.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q4: What role does correctness play in written communication?</strong>
          <br />
          A4: Correctness builds trust. Any grammar, punctuation, or factual error can discredit the writer and mislead the reader.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q5: Why is coherence necessary for written messages?</strong>
          <br />
          A5: Coherence makes writing easier to read. Use proper paragraphing, transitions (however, therefore, moreover), and logical sequencing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q6: How does completeness contribute to effective written communication?</strong>
          <br />
          A6: Completeness reduces back-and-forths. Include all necessary information, context, dates, and actions expected.
