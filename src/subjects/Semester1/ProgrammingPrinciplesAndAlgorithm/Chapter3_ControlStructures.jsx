      <h2>Chapter 3: Control Structures</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Q1: What are control structures?</strong>
        <br />
        A1: Control structures are programming constructs that allow the control flow of a program to be altered based on certain conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q2: What are the types of control structures in C?</strong>
        <br />
        A2: Types include sequential, selection (if, if-else, switch), and iteration (for, while, do-while) control structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3: Explain the if statement.</strong>
        <br />
        A3: The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q4: Explain the if-else statement.</strong>
        <br />
        A4: The if-else statement executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q5: Explain the switch statement.</strong>
        <br />
        A5: The switch statement selects one of several code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q6: Explain the for loop.</strong>
        <br />
        A6: The for loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q7: Explain the while loop.</strong>
        <br />
        A7: The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q8: Explain the do-while loop.</strong>
        <br />
        A8: The do-while loop repeats a block of code at least once, and then continues to repeat as long as a specified condition is true.
