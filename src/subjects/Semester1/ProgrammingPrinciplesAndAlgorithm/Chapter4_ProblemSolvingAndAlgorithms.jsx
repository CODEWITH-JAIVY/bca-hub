          <strong>Q1: What is problem-solving?</strong>
          <br />
          A1: Problem-solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing a solution, and implementing and evaluating that solution. It's a fundamental skill in programming and in life!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q2: What are the steps in problem-solving?</strong>
          <br />
          A2: The typical steps include:
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li><strong>Define the Problem:</strong> Clearly identify and describe the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze the Problem:</strong> Gather information and understand the problem's scope and constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Possible Solutions:</strong> Brainstorm different approaches to solve the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Select the Best Solution:</strong> Evaluate the alternatives and choose the most appropriate solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement the Solution:</strong> Put the selected solution into action.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluate the Results:</strong> Assess whether the implemented solution effectively solves the problem.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
         <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Example:</strong> To illustrate this, consider a scenario: A program that calculates the area of a circle is producing incorrect results. Apply the six steps above to resolve this issue.

          <strong>Q3: What is an algorithm in problem-solving?</strong>
          <br />
          A3: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a specific problem. It's a precise sequence of instructions that, when followed, leads to the desired output.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q4: How do you design an algorithm?</strong>
          <br />
          A4: To design an algorithm:
           <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li><strong>Understand the Problem:</strong> Clearly define what needs to be solved.</li>
            <li><strong>Break it Down:</strong> Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Define Inputs and Outputs:</strong> Identify what data is needed and what the result should be.</li>
            <li><strong>Specify Steps:</strong> Determine the order of steps and how each step transforms the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Test and Refine:</strong> Verify the algorithm with different inputs and adjust as necessary.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q5: What are some common algorithm design techniques?</strong>
          <br />
          A5: Some examples are: 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Breaking down a problem into smaller, similar subproblems, solving each subproblem recursively, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Breaking down a problem into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results to avoid recomputation.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q6: How do you represent Algorithms?</strong>
          <br />
          A6: Algorithms can be expressed in mulitple ways including:
           <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> A high-level, informal description of the algorithm using natural language and programming-like constructs.</li>
            <li><strong>Flowcharts:</strong> A graphical representation of the algorithm using standard symbols.</li>
             <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> An expression using a formal, machine-readable programming language.</li>
          </ul>

        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Why is problem definition important in problem-solving?</strong>
            <br/>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What are the characteristics of an effective algorithm?</strong>
            <br/>
