          <strong>Q1: What is problem-solving?</strong>
          <br />
          A1: Problem-solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing a solution, and implementing and evaluating that solution. It's a fundamental skill in programming and in life!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q2: What are the steps in problem-solving?</strong>
          <br />
          A2: Steps include defining the problem, analyzing the problem, generating possible solutions, selecting the best solution, implementing the solution, and evaluating the results. This systematic approach helps to solve the problem effectively.

          <strong>Q3: What is an algorithm in problem-solving?</strong>
          <br />
          A3: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a specific problem. It's a precise sequence of instructions that, when followed, leads to the desired output.

          <strong>Q4: How do you design an algorithm?</strong>
          <br />
          A4: Design an algorithm by understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller steps, defining inputs and outputs, and specifying the order of steps. This often involves trial and error and refining your initial approach.

          <li>
            <strong>Why is problem definition important in problem-solving?</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Clearly defining the problem helps focus efforts, ensures the right problem is being addressed, and guides the development of effective solutions.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What are the key strategies for analyzing a problem effectively?</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Strategies include breaking the problem into smaller parts, identifying constraints, considering different perspectives, and gathering relevant information.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Describe different techniques for generating possible solutions to a problem.</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Techniques include brainstorming, researching existing solutions, and exploring creative approaches.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How do you evaluate the best solution among several alternatives?</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Evaluate solutions by considering factors such as cost, feasibility, effectiveness, and impact.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Explain the steps to implement a problem solution.</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Steps include planning, allocating resources, assigning tasks, and monitoring progress.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why is it important to evaluate the results of a problem-solving process?</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Evaluating results helps determine if the solution was effective, identify areas for improvement, and prevent similar problems in the future.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What are the characteristics of an effective algorithm?</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>An effective algorithm should be clear, precise, finite, efficient, and produce the correct output.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How does algorithm design influence the efficiency of a program?</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>Algorithm design determines the time and resources required to execute a program. A well-designed algorithm can significantly improve a program's performance.</em>
