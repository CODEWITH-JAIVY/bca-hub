      <p>
        <strong>Q1: What is problem-solving?</strong>
        <br />
        A1: Problem-solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing a solution, and implementing and evaluating that solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q2: What are the steps in problem-solving?</strong>
        <br />
        A2: Steps include defining the problem, analyzing the problem, generating possible solutions, selecting the best solution, implementing the solution, and evaluating the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3: What is an algorithm in problem-solving?</strong>
        <br />
        A3: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a specific problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q4: How do you design an algorithm?</strong>
        <br />
        A4: Design an algorithm by understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller steps, defining inputs and outputs, and specifying the order of steps.
