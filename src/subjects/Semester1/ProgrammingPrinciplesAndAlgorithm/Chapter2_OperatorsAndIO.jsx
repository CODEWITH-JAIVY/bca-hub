      <h2>Chapter 2: Operators and I/O</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Q1: What are operators in C?</strong>
        <br />
        A1: Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on operands (variables and values).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q2: What are different types of operators in C?</strong>
        <br />
        A2: Types include arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators, assignment operators, and bitwise operators.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3: What are arithmetic operators?</strong>
        <br />
        A3: Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q4: What are relational operators?</strong>
        <br />
        A4: Relational operators compare two operands and return a Boolean value (true or false), such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q5: What are logical operators?</strong>
        <br />
        A5: Logical operators combine two or more conditions and return a Boolean value, such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q6: What are assignment operators?</strong>
        <br />
        A6: Assignment operators assign a value to a variable, such as =, +=, -=, *=, and /=.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q7: What are input/output (I/O) functions in C?</strong>
        <br />
        A7: I/O functions allow programs to receive input from the user and display output, such as printf() for output and scanf() for input.
