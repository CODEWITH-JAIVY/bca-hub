      <p>
        <strong>Q1: What is an algorithm?</strong>
        <br />
        A1: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a specific problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q2: What are the characteristics of a good algorithm?</strong>
        <br />
        A2: A good algorithm should be clear, precise, finite, effective, and have a well-defined input and output.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3: What is a flowchart?</strong>
        <br />
        A3: A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, using symbols to represent different operations and steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q4: What are the basic symbols used in a flowchart?</strong>
        <br />
        A4: Common symbols include terminal (start/end), process, decision, input/output, and connector.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q5: How do you create an algorithm for a simple problem?</strong>
        <br />
        A5: Identify the problem, define the input and output, outline the steps required to solve the problem, and test the algorithm with different inputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q6: How does a flowchart help in problem-solving?</strong>
        <br />
        A6: A flowchart provides a visual representation of the problem-solving process, making it easier to understand and debug the algorithm.
