      <p>
        <strong>Q1: What is a computer?</strong>
        <br />
        A1: A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q2: What are the basic components of a computer system?</strong>
        <br />
        A2: The basic components include the input unit, central processing unit (CPU), memory unit, and output unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3: Explain the function of the input unit.</strong>
        <br />
        A3: The input unit allows data and instructions to enter the computer system, typically through devices like keyboards and mice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q4: What is the role of the CPU?</strong>
        <br />
        A4: The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q5: What is the purpose of the memory unit?</strong>
        <br />
        A5: The memory unit stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently for the CPU to access.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q6: What does the output unit do?</strong>
        <br />
        A6: The output unit displays or presents the processed information to the user, using devices like monitors and printers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q7: What are different types of number systems used in computers?</strong>
        <br />
        A7: Common number systems include binary (base 2), decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q8: Why is the binary number system important in computers?</strong>
        <br />
        A8: Computers use binary because their electronic circuits have two states: on (1) and off (0), making binary the natural language for representing data and instructions.
