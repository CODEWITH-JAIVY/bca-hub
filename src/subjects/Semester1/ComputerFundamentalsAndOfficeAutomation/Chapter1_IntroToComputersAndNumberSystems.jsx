      {/* Number Systems */}
      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Number Systems</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Computers use different number systems to represent data and instructions. Understanding these systems is fundamental to computer science.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q8: What are different types of number systems used in computers?</strong>
          <br />
          A8: Common number systems include binary (base 2), decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q9: Explain the binary number system.</strong>
          <br />
          A9: The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit represents a power of 2. For example, the binary number 1011 is equal to:
          <br />
          <code>(1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11</code> in decimal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q10: Explain the octal number system.</strong>
          <br />
          A10: The octal number system uses eight digits: 0 to 7. Each digit represents a power of 8. For example, the octal number 235 is equal to:
          <br />
          <code>(2 * 8^2) + (3 * 8^1) + (5 * 8^0) = 128 + 24 + 5 = 157</code> in decimal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q11: Explain the hexadecimal number system.</strong>
          <br />
          A11: The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen digits: 0 to 9 and A to F (where A=10, B=11, ..., F=15). Each digit represents a power of 16. For example, the hexadecimal number 2AF is equal to:
          <br />
          <code>(2 * 16^2) + (10 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0) = 512 + 160 + 15 = 687</code> in decimal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q12: Why is the binary number system important in computers?</strong>
          <br />
          A12: Computers use binary because their electronic circuits have two states: on (1) and off (0), making binary the natural language for representing data and instructions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q13: How do you convert between number systems?</strong>
          <br />
          A13:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li><strong>Decimal to Binary:</strong> Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainders. The binary number is the remainders read in reverse order.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2 and sum the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal to Octal:</strong> Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 8 and record the remainders.</li>
            <li><strong>Octal to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each octal digit by its corresponding power of 8 and sum the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal to Hexadecimal:</strong> Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16 and record the remainders (using A-F for remainders 10-15).</li>
            <li><strong>Hexadecimal to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each hexadecimal digit by its corresponding power of 16 and sum the results.</li>
          </ul>
          <em>Example:</em> Convert decimal 25 to binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q14: How do you perform simple addition and subtraction in binary?</strong>
          <br />
          A14: Binary addition and subtraction follow similar rules to decimal arithmetic, but with only two digits (0 and 1). When adding, 1 + 1 = 10 (0 with a carry of 1). When subtracting, you may need to borrow from higher bits.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Q15: How do you perform simple multiplication in binary?</strong>
          <br />
          A15: Binary multiplication is similar to decimal multiplication, but uses binary digits. It involves multiplying the multiplicand by each digit of the multiplier and then adding the results.
