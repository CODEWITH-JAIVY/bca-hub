                <h3>1. What is cloud computing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning their own IT infrastructure, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider, enabling them to scale up or down based on their needs and pay only for what they use.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of purchasing and maintaining servers for hosting applications, a business can rent server space from a cloud provider like AWS or Microsoft Azure, paying for only the resources it consumes.</p>

                <h3>2. What are the benefits of cloud computing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing offers numerous benefits that make it a popular choice for businesses and individuals. Some of the main benefits include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Cloud computing eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive physical hardware and software. Instead, they can rent these resources on-demand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Cloud resources can be easily scaled up or down depending on the demand. Businesses can add more resources when needed and scale down during off-peak periods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Cloud services are available anywhere and at any time, enabling remote work and access to applications and data from any device with an internet connection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Cloud providers offer high levels of redundancy, ensuring that services are available with minimal downtime and outages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Global Access:</strong> Cloud computing allows businesses to reach customers or users from all around the world, providing a globally distributed infrastructure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>3. What are the deployment models in cloud computing?</h3>
                <p>
                    The deployment models in cloud computing determine how cloud services are provided, managed, and accessed. These models can be classified into four main types:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Cloud services are provided by a third-party vendor and are made available to the public over the internet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> A cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, either hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them, offering greater flexibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Cloud:</strong> Shared infrastructure used by a specific group of organizations with similar needs, often used for joint ventures or collaborations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>4. What is a public cloud?</h3>
                <p>
                    A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is owned and operated by a third-party provider and made available to the general public. These clouds are highly scalable and offer a pay-as-you-go model, meaning users only pay for the resources they consume. Public clouds are ideal for businesses with variable workloads, as they allow for quick provisioning and elasticity.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are all public cloud providers.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>5. What is a private cloud?</h3>
                <p>
                    A private cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is used exclusively by a single organization. The cloud can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. A private cloud offers the organization greater control over the infrastructure, security, and compliance compared to a public cloud. This is ideal for businesses that have strict security or regulatory requirements.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A large financial institution might operate a private cloud to ensure that sensitive customer data is handled securely and meets regulatory standards.</p>
