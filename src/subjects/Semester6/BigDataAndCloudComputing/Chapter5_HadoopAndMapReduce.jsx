                <strong>Q1: What is Hadoop?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Hadoop is an open-source framework used for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.

            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the core components of Hadoop?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Core components include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is HDFS?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed file system that provides scalable and reliable storage for large datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is MapReduce in Hadoop?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: MapReduce is a programming model and software framework in Hadoop used for parallel processing of large datasets.

            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are the phases in MapReduce?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Phases include mapping, shuffling, and reducing.
