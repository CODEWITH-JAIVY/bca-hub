                <h3>1. What are the common techniques for processing Big Data?</h3>
                <p>
                    A1: Common techniques for processing Big Data include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>MapReduce:</strong> A programming model for processing large datasets in parallel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Apache Spark:</strong> A fast and general-purpose distributed computing system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stream Processing:</strong> Processing data in real-time as it arrives.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

                <h3>2. What is MapReduce?</h3>
                <p>
                    A2: <strong>MapReduce</strong> is a programming model and software framework for processing large datasets in parallel across distributed computing systems. It was introduced by Google to process vast amounts of data in a scalable manner. It breaks down the task into two major functions: Map and Reduce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - <strong>Map Function:</strong> The map function processes input data into key-value pairs. This allows for parallel processing, where different chunks of the data can be processed simultaneously.
                    <br />
                    - <strong>Reduce Function:</strong> The reduce function takes the key-value pairs produced by the map function and combines them to produce a result, usually by performing some aggregation or transformation.
                </p>

                <h3>3. How does MapReduce work?</h3>
                <p>
                    A3: <strong>MapReduce</strong> works by dividing the input data into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel. Here's the step-by-step process:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> The data is split into smaller chunks (called splits) across multiple nodes in the cluster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Map Phase:</strong> Each chunk is processed by the map function on different nodes. The map function converts each data item into a key-value pair.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shuffling Phase:</strong> The key-value pairs are shuffled so that all values with the same key are grouped together.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce Phase:</strong> The reduce function processes these grouped key-value pairs and performs aggregation or other transformations to produce the final result.</li>
                        <li><strong>Output:</strong> The result is stored in a distributed file system like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>4. What is Apache Spark?</h3>
                <p>
                    A4: <strong>Apache Spark</strong> is a fast and general-purpose distributed computing system used for Big Data processing and analytics. Unlike MapReduce, which stores intermediate data in disk-based storage, Spark performs all its processing in memory, making it significantly faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Spark supports a variety of programming languages, including Java, Scala, Python, and R.
                    <br />
                    - It can perform tasks such as batch processing, real-time stream processing, machine learning, and graph processing.
                    <br />
                    - It is widely used in Big Data ecosystems for large-scale data processing and analytics.
