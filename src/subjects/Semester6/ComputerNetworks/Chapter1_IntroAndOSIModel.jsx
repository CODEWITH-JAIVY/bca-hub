                <strong>Q1: What is a computer network?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: A computer network is a set of interconnected computing devices that can communicate and share resources, such as files, printers, and Internet access.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the types of computer networks?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Types include Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the OSI model?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are the layers of the OSI model?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: The layers are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is the function of the Physical layer?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: The Physical layer transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is the function of the Data Link layer?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: The Data Link layer provides error-free transmission of data frames between two directly connected nodes.
