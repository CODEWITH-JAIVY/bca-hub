                <strong>Q1: What are the steps in database design?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Steps include requirements analysis, conceptual design, logical design, and physical design.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What is requirements analysis?</strong>
                <br />

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is conceptual design?</strong>
