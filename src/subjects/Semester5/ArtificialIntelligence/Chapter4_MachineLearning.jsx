                <strong>Q1: What is machine learning?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Machine learning is a type of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the types of machine learning?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is supervised learning?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Supervised learning uses labeled data to train a model to make predictions or classifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are the common supervised learning algorithms?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is unsupervised learning?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to discover patterns, clusters, or relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are the common unsupervised learning algorithms?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).
