                <strong>Q1: What is knowledge representation in AI?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Knowledge representation is the method used to encode knowledge about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the types of knowledge representation?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Types include logical representation, semantic networks, and frames.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is logical representation?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Logical representation uses formal logic, such as propositional logic and predicate logic, to represent knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What are semantic networks?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Semantic networks represent knowledge as a graph with nodes representing objects or concepts and edges representing relationships between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are frames?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Frames are data structures that represent knowledge about a particular object or situation, containing slots for various attributes and values.
