        <h3>Introduction to Knowledge Representation</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the fascinating realm of Knowledge Representation in AI! In this chapter, we will dive deep into how AI systems store, organize, and use knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Knowledge representation is the method used to encode information about the world into a form that a computer system can understand, manipulate, and utilize.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of knowledge representation is to enable AI systems to reason, make decisions, and interact intelligently with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Importance:</strong> Knowledge representation is crucial because it determines how efficiently and effectively an AI system can use its knowledge. Good knowledge representation makes it easier for the system to learn, reason, and solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Characteristics of Good Knowledge Representation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expressiveness:</strong> The ability to represent a wide range of knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The ability to access and use knowledge quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> The ability to understand the meaning of the representation.</li>
            <li><strong>Inference:</strong> The ability to draw new conclusions from existing knowledge.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Knowledge Representation</h3>
        <p>
          There are various methods for knowledge representation, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore some of the most common ones:
        </p>

        {/* Logical Representation */}
        <section>
          <h4>Logical Representation</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Logical representation uses formal logic to represent knowledge. This can be done through propositional logic (statements that are true or false) or predicate logic (which allows for relationships between objects).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Propositional Logic:</strong> Represents knowledge using propositions (statements) that are either true or false.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Predicate Logic:</strong> Extends propositional logic to include objects, properties, and relationships. It allows more complex reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Propositional Logic: P = "It is raining." Q = "The ground is wet." Rule: IF P THEN Q.</li>
              <li>Predicate Logic: ∀x (Cat(x) → Animal(x)) (All cats are animals). Cat(Tom) (Tom is a cat).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear semantics.</li>
              <li>Enables formal reasoning and deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Can be complex and challenging to implement.</li>
              <li>Not suitable for uncertain or incomplete knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Semantic Networks */}
        <section>
          <h4>Semantic Networks</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Semantic networks represent knowledge as a graph where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relationships between concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nodes:</strong> Represent objects, concepts, or events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Edges:</strong> Represent relationships (e.g., "is-a", "has-a", "part-of").
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> A node "Robin" connected to a node "Bird" with an "is-a" edge. Another node "Bird" is connected to "Has-wings" with "true".
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Easy to visualize and understand.</li>
              <li>Good for hierarchical relationships.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Can become complex with many relationships.</li>
              <li>Not as precise as logical representations.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Frames */}
        <section>
          <h4>Frames</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Frames are data structures used to represent knowledge about a particular object or situation. They provide a structured way to store attributes and values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Slots:</strong> Represent attributes or properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Values:</strong> Represent specific values for the attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> A "House" frame with slots like "Type" (e.g., "Villa"), "Location" (e.g., "City"), "Color" (e.g., "White").
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Well-organized and structured.</li>
              <li>Easy to represent stereotypical knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Not as flexible as other methods.</li>
              <li>Can be rigid and less suitable for complex relationships.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Production Rules */}
        <section>
          <h4>Production Rules</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Production rules use an "IF-THEN" format to represent knowledge. They specify actions to be taken if certain conditions are met.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>IF-THEN Format:</strong> IF (condition) THEN (action).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> IF temperature  { ">"}30°C THEN turn on AC. IF low fuel THEN go to gas station.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Easy to understand and implement.</li>
              <li>Good for expert systems and decision-making.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Can become complex with many rules.</li>
              <li>Difficult to manage when rules interact.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Scripts */}
        <section>
          <h4>Scripts</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Scripts represent knowledge about sequences of events in typical scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use for Events:</strong> Scripts describe a series of actions that typically occur in a particular situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> A script for "Going to a restaurant" includes entering, ordering, eating, paying, and leaving. Another example: "Attending a class" includes entering, sitting down, listening to the teacher, taking notes, asking questions, and leaving.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Help understand and predict events.</li>
              <li>Useful for natural language processing and story understanding.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Can be rigid and fail with unexpected events.</li>
              <li>Difficult to create for complex situations.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
