        <h3>Introduction to Expert Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the fascinating world of expert systems! In this chapter, we'll dive deep into what expert systems are, how they work, and where they're used. Expert systems are a significant area of AI that attempts to capture human expertise in a computer program.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What are Expert Systems?</strong> An expert system is a computer program that simulates the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field. They are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if-then rules, rather than through conventional procedural code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose of Expert Systems:</strong> The main goal of expert systems is to provide expert-level advice or make expert decisions in a specific domain. They can assist human experts, or in some cases, replace them. They can be used to solve problems, diagnose issues, make predictions, and offer recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>History and Evolution:</strong> Expert systems emerged in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s. Early systems like DENDRAL and MYCIN showed the potential of expert systems in scientific and medical domains. Since then, they have evolved to incorporate more advanced techniques for knowledge representation and reasoning.

        <h3>Components of an Expert System</h3>
        <p>
          Expert systems are typically composed of several key parts working together. Let's look at each one in detail.
        </p>

        {/* Knowledge Base */}
        <h4>Knowledge Base</h4>
        <p>
          The knowledge base is the heart of an expert system. It stores all the domain-specific knowledge needed to solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Knowledge Representation:</strong> Knowledge is usually represented in the form of:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Rules:</strong> "If-then" statements that describe logical relationships. For example, "IF the patient has a fever AND a cough, THEN the patient may have the flu."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facts:</strong> Statements that are true in the domain. For example, "A high fever is a temperature over 102Â°F."
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Knowledge Acquisition:</strong> Building the knowledge base involves knowledge acquisition, the process of collecting and organizing expert knowledge. This is often done through interviews with experts, reviewing documents, and observing experts in action.
        </p>
        {/* Inference Engine */}
        <h4>Inference Engine</h4>
        <p>
          The inference engine is the brain of the system, using the knowledge base to make logical inferences and draw conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inference Methods:</strong> Two primary inference methods are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Forward Chaining:</strong> Starts with known facts and applies rules to derive new facts, moving towards a conclusion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backward Chaining:</strong> Starts with a hypothesis (a possible conclusion) and works backward to find supporting facts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
           {/* working Memory */}
        <h4>Working Memory</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>What is working memory</strong>: Working memory is a temporary storage area that holds the current facts and data that the inference engine is using during its reasoning process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Role of working memory:</strong>
           The working memory is updated as the inference engine deduces new information.
        </p>

        {/* User Interface */}
        <h4>User Interface</h4>
        <p>
          The user interface is how users interact with the expert system. It must be easy to use, or else the system won't be useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Importance of User-Friendly Interface:</strong> A good interface allows users to:
          <ul>
            <li>Input information easily.</li>
            <li>Understand the system's reasoning.</li>
            <li>Receive clear recommendations or advice.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
