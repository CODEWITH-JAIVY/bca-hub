                <strong>Q1: What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the goals of AI?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Goals include creating expert systems, implementing human intelligence in machines, and solving complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What are the different approaches to AI?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Approaches include symbolic AI, machine learning, and deep learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is symbolic AI?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Symbolic AI, also known as rule-based AI, uses formal logic and rules to represent knowledge and make inferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is machine learning?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Machine learning is a type of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What is deep learning?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data and learn complex patterns.
