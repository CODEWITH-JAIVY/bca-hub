                <p>
                    Welcome to the world of NoSQL databases and MongoDB! In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of NoSQL databases,
                    focusing specifically on MongoDB, a leading document-oriented database. We'll explore its structure, setup, and integration
                    with Node.js. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of MongoDB and how to perform fundamental
                    database operations using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Why do we need this:</strong>: In today's data-driven world, traditional relational databases sometimes fall short
                    in handling the volume, variety, and velocity of modern data. This is where NoSQL databases, like MongoDB,
                    step in to offer a scalable and flexible solution.

                <h3>Introduction to NoSQL and MongoDB</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>What are NoSQL Databases?</strong>
                    <br />
                    NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that
                    is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose of NoSQL Databases</strong>
                    <br />
                    NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, offering
                    scalability, high performance, and flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Advantages of NoSQL Databases</strong>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easily scales horizontally to accommodate large data volumes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Dynamic schemas allow for easy adaptation to changing data.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Optimized for high-speed data retrieval and storage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Difference Between SQL and NoSQL Databases</strong>
                    <br />
                     SQL databases are relational, use structured query language (SQL) for data manipulation, and are schema-based. NoSQL databases are non-relational, use various data models (document, graph, key-value, column-family), and have flexible schemas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What is MongoDB?</strong>
                    <br />
                    MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's designed to be scalable,
                    fast, and easy to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose of MongoDB</strong>
                    <br />
                    MongoDB is used to store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently. It's ideal for applications that require
                    flexible schemas and high performance.

                    <strong>Key Features of MongoDB</strong>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Document-Oriented:</strong> Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Can easily scale horizontally.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Designed for high-speed data retrieval.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexible Schema:</strong> No need for a predefined schema.</li>

                <h3>MongoDB Data Model</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Documents</strong>
                    <br />
                    Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. They are similar to JSON objects, containing data in key-value pairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Collections</strong>
                    <br />
                    Collections are groups of documents. They are similar to tables in relational databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fields</strong>
                    <br />
                    Fields are the individual key-value pairs within a document. They represent the data attributes of the document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Embedded Documents</strong>
                    <br />
                    Embedded documents are documents nested within another document. This allows for complex data structures within a single document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Arrays</strong>
                    <br />
                    Arrays are used to store lists of values within a document. They can store multiple values of the same type or different types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Object ID</strong>
                    <br />
                    Object ID is a unique identifier automatically added to each document by MongoDB. It's used as the primary key.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Integrating MongoDB with Node.js</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Using the MongoDB Node.js Driver</strong>
                    <br />
                    The official MongoDB Node.js driver allows you to connect to and interact with MongoDB databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Connecting to a MongoDB Database</strong>
                    <br />
                    To connect, you need to use the <code>MongoClient</code> class from the driver and provide the connection string.
                </p>
