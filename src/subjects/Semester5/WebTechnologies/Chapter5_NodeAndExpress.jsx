      <h2>Chapter 5: Node.js and Express.js</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the world of server-side JavaScript! In this chapter, we'll
        dive into Node.js and Express.js, two powerful technologies that allow
        you to build robust and scalable web applications. We'll explore their
        core concepts, key features, and how to use them to create web servers.
      </p>

      {/* Introduction to Node.js */}
      <h3>Introduction to Node.js</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform
        JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a
        browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers
        Google Chrome, to execute code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for
        server-side scripting, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages and
        applications. It is particularly well-suited for real-time applications
        and network programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>History and Evolution:</strong> Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009,
        Node.js was designed to push the limits of what could be done on the
        server-side with JavaScript. Its evolution has been marked by a vibrant
        community and a rich ecosystem of modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Features:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Asynchronous and Event-Driven:</strong> Uses non-blocking I/O
            to handle multiple requests concurrently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Runs on various operating systems
            like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Ecosystem:</strong> Has a vast collection of open-source
            libraries available through npm.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why Node.js?</strong> Node.js allows you to use JavaScript for
        both front-end and back-end development, streamlining the development
        process and making it easier to share code and expertise across the
        stack.
      </p>

      {/* Core Concepts of Node.js */}
      <h3>Core Concepts of Node.js</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-blocking I/O:</strong> Node.js handles I/O operations in a
        non-blocking manner, meaning that it can continue executing other code
        while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> When reading a file, Node.js doesn't wait for
        the file to be read before moving on to other tasks. It reads the file
        asynchronously.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Event Loop:</strong> The event loop is what allows Node.js to
        perform non-blocking I/O operations. It's constantly monitoring for new
        events and processing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Modules:</strong> Node.js has built-in modules that offer
        functionality for various tasks.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>http</code>: For creating HTTP servers and clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>fs</code>: For interacting with the file system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>path</code>: For working with file and directory paths.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NPM (Node Package Manager):</strong> npm is the default package
        manager for Node.js, allowing you to install, share, and manage
        JavaScript packages.
      </p>

      {/* Introduction to Express.js */}
      <h3>Introduction to Express.js</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Express.js is a minimalist and flexible
        Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features
        for building web and mobile applications, as well as APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Express.js simplifies the process of creating
        web servers and handling HTTP requests, making it easier to build web
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimalist:</strong> It is unopinionated and doesn't force you
            to use any specific architecture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible:</strong> It allows you to use any third-party
            modules for tasks like templating and database integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Robust Routing:</strong> It provides a powerful routing
            system.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      {/* Key Features of Express.js */}
      <h3>Key Features of Express.js</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Routing:</strong> Express.js provides a routing system that
        allows you to define handlers for different HTTP methods and URLs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> You can define a route for handling GET
        requests to the "/users" URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Middleware:</strong> Middleware functions are functions that have
        access to the request object, the response object, and the next
        middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Templating:</strong> Express.js supports various templating
        engines like Pug and EJS, allowing you to dynamically generate HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Static Files:</strong> Express.js can serve static files like
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Middlewares</strong>: Express middleware functions are functions
        that have access to the request object (req), the response object
        (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s
        request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted
        by a variable named next.
