                <strong>Q1: What is numerical integration?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Numerical integration is the process of approximating the value of a definite integral using numerical techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the methods of numerical integration?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Methods include the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Gaussian quadrature.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is the trapezoidal rule?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: The trapezoidal rule approximates the integral by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is Simpson's rule?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Simpson's rule approximates the integral by dividing the area under the curve into parabolas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is numerical differentiation?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Numerical differentiation is the process of approximating the derivative of a function using numerical techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are the methods of numerical differentiation?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Methods include the forward difference, backward difference, and central difference.
