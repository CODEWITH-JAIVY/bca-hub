                <strong>Q1: What is interpolation?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Interpolation is the process of estimating values between known data points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What is approximation?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Approximation is the process of finding a function that closely resembles a given function but is simpler or easier to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What are the common interpolation methods?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: Methods include linear interpolation, polynomial interpolation, and spline interpolation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is linear interpolation?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: Linear interpolation estimates values between two known data points by drawing a straight line between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What is polynomial interpolation?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Polynomial interpolation fits a polynomial function through a set of data points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: What are spline interpolations?</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Spline interpolations divide data into smaller subsets and interpolate the data.
