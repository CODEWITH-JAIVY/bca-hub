                <h3>Introduction to Interpolation and Approximation</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the fascinating world of interpolation and approximation! These techniques are essential in numerical analysis for estimating values and simplifying complex functions.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Interpolation:</strong> Interpolation is the method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. It involves finding a function that passes through all the given data points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Approximation:</strong> Approximation, on the other hand, is the process of finding a function that is "close" to a given function but is usually simpler or easier to work with. Unlike interpolation, it does not require passing through all the data points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Difference:</strong> The main difference is that interpolation passes through known data points, while approximation does not necessarily pass through any data points. Interpolation focuses on accuracy at the data points, whereas approximation focuses on overall closeness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Interpolation helps to estimate values at points where data is missing. Approximation helps to simplify functions to make them easier to understand or use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Applications:</strong> These techniques are widely used in engineering, computer graphics, data analysis, and many other fields.

                {/* Linear Interpolation */}
                <div>
                    <h4>Linear Interpolation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Linear interpolation estimates values between two known data points by drawing a straight line between them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Formula:</strong> Given two points (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) and (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), the value y at any point x between x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>1</sub> is:
                        <br />
                        y = y<sub>0</sub> + ((y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>0</sub>) / (x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>0</sub>)) * (x - x<sub>0</sub>)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example:</strong> If we know that f(2) = 4 and f(4) = 8, and we want to estimate f(3), we use linear interpolation:
                        <br />
                        y = 4 + ((8 - 4) / (4 - 2)) * (3 - 2) = 4 + (4 / 2) * 1 = 6
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple and easy to understand and implement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Not very accurate for nonlinear functions; the approximation quality decreases away from the known points.
                    </p>
                </div>

                {/* Polynomial Interpolation */}
                <div>
                    <h4>Polynomial Interpolation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Polynomial interpolation involves fitting a polynomial function through a set of data points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Lagrange Polynomials:</strong> One method for constructing the polynomial. It builds a polynomial from a set of points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Newton's Divided Difference Method:</strong> Another way to construct the polynomial, often more efficient for computation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example:</strong> Given three points (1, 2), (2, 5), and (3, 10), a quadratic polynomial can be fit through these points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Advantages:</strong> More accurate than linear interpolation for functions that are not straight lines; can provide smooth curves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can oscillate between points, especially with high-degree polynomials (Runge's phenomenon); can be computationally expensive.
                    </p>
                </div>

                {/* Spline Interpolation */}
                <div>
                    <h4>Spline Interpolation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Spline interpolation involves dividing data into smaller subsets and interpolating each subset with a low-degree polynomial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Types of Splines:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Linear Splines:</strong> Connect data points with straight lines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quadratic Splines:</strong> Use quadratic polynomials for each interval.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cubic Splines:</strong> Use cubic polynomials for each interval, providing smoother curves.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example:</strong> To interpolate a set of five points using cubic splines, four different cubic polynomials are used, one for each interval between the points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Advantages:</strong> More accurate than linear interpolation; smoother than polynomial interpolation, especially for high degrees; avoids Runge's phenomenon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More complex than linear interpolation; boundary conditions must be chosen carefully.

                <h3>Approximation Methods</h3>
                 <p>
                    Approximation methods are used to find a function that closely resembles a given function but is simpler or easier to work with. They do not necessarily pass through the known data points.
                    </p>
                 <p>
                 Approximation is the process of finding a function that closely resembles a given function, often for the purpose of simplification or to handle situations where an exact representation is not known or practical. Unlike interpolation, which requires the function to pass through specific data points, approximation seeks to minimize the overall error between the approximation and the true function, without necessarily matching at any particular point. Approximation techniques are particularly useful when dealing with complex functions, data with noise, or situations where an exact representation is too computationally expensive to use.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                     Approximation methods are used in numerous fields, including:
                     </p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><strong>Curve Fitting:</strong> Finding a mathematical function that best fits a set of data points. This is common in statistics and data analysis.</li>
                  <li><strong>Function Simplification:</strong> Replacing a complex function with a simpler one (e.g., approximating a trigonometric function with a polynomial).</li>
                  <li><strong>Data Compression:</strong> Representing a large dataset with a smaller set of parameters, allowing for more efficient storage and transmission.</li>
                  <li><strong>Numerical Integration and Differentiation:</strong> Approximating integrals and derivatives of complex functions for which exact analytical methods are not feasible.</li>
                  <li><strong>Signal Processing:</strong> Approximating complex signals with a set of basic functions for analysis and manipulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Approximating the relationships in the training data using various models.</li>
                  </ul>
                   <p>
                 Key approximation methods include:
                 </p>
                     <ul>
                     <li><strong>Taylor Series:</strong> Approximating a function using its derivatives at a single point.</li>
                     <li><strong>Fourier Series:</strong> Approximating periodic functions with a sum of sine and cosine functions.</li>
                     <li><strong>Least Squares:</strong> Finding the best-fitting curve that minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors.</li>
                     <li><strong>Chebyshev Polynomials:</strong> Used for polynomial approximations, particularly to minimize errors over a specific interval.</li>
                     <li><strong>Spline Approximation:</strong> A piecewise polynomial approximation that can provide better local accuracy than global methods like polynomials.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>
                        Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific requirements of the application.
