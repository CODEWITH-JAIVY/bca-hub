                <strong>Q1: What is a differential equation?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates a function with its derivatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the types of differential equations?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Types include ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is an ordinary differential equation (ODE)?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: An ODE is a differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and its derivatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is a partial differential equation (PDE)?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: A PDE is a differential equation containing one or more functions of several independent variables and their partial derivatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are the numerical methods for solving ODEs?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Methods include Euler's method and Runge-Kutta methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q6: Explain Euler's method.</strong>
                <br />
                A6: Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ODEs with a given initial value.
