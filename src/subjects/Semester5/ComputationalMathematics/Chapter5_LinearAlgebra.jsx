                <strong>Q1: What is linear algebra?</strong>
                <br />
                A1: Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with vector spaces and linear mappings between those spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q2: What are the key concepts in linear algebra?</strong>
                <br />
                A2: Key concepts include vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q3: What is a vector space?</strong>
                <br />
                A3: A vector space is a set of objects (vectors) that can be added together and multiplied by scalars.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q4: What is a matrix?</strong>
                <br />
                A4: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q5: What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors?</strong>
                <br />
                A5: Eigenvalues are the set of scalars associated with a linear system of equations (matrix equation) that transform matrix equation into diagonal matrix in order to represent the matrix equation into simple equations. Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that do not change direction when a linear transformation is applied to them.
